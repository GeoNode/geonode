GeoNode Django Apps
===================

The user interface of a GeoNode site is built on top of the Django web
framework.  GeoNode includes a few "apps" (reusable Django modules) to support
development of those user interfaces.  While these apps have reasonable default
configurations, for customized GeoNode sites you will probably want to adjust
these apps for your specific needs.

    {% load base_tags %}
    {% num_ratings map as num_votes %}

    <p>Map votes: {{num_votes}}.</p>

categories

  Returns topic categories and the count of objects in each category.


``geonode.documents`` - Document creation and management
========================================================

  Manages uploaded files that can be related to maps.  Documents can be any type of file that is included in the
  ALLOWED_DOCUMENTS_TYPES setting.

``settings.py`` Entries
-----------------------

ALLOWED_DOCUMENT_TYPES
  Default: ``['doc', 'docx', 'xls', 'xslx', 'pdf', 'zip', 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'tif', 'tiff', 'png', 'gif', 'txt']``

  A list of acceptable file extensions that can be uploaded to the Documents app.

MAX_DOCUMENT_SIZE
  Default: ``2``

  The maximum size (in megabytes) that an upload will be before it gets rejected.

``geonode.layers`` - Layer creation and geospatial data management
==================================================================
This Django app provides support for managing and manipulating single geospatial datasets known as layers.

Models
------
* Attribute - Feature attributes for a layer managed by the GeoNode.
* Layer - A data layer managed by the GeoNode
* Style - A data layer's style managed by the GeoNode

Views
-----
* Creating, viewing, browsing, editing, and deleting layers and their metadata

Template Tags
-------------
featured_layers
  Returns the 7 newest layers.

layer_thumbnail <layer>
  Returns the layer's thumbnail.

``manage.py`` Commands
----------------------

importlayers
   ``python manage.py importlayers``

   Brings a data file or a directory full of data files into a
   GeoNode site.  Layers are added to the Django database, the
   GeoServer configuration, and the GeoNetwork metadata index.

updatelayers
  ``python manage.py updatelayers``

  Scan GeoServer for data that has not been added to GeoNode.

``geonode.maps`` - Map creation and geospatial data management
==============================================================

This Django app provides some support for managing and manipulating geospatial
datasets.  In particular, it provides tools for editing, viewing, and searching
metadata for data layers, and for editing, viewing, and searching maps that
aggregate data layers to display data about a particular topic.

Models
------

* Map - A collection of data layers composed in a particular order to form a map
* MapLayer - A model that maintains some map-specific information related to a layer, such as the z-indexing order.

Views
-----

The maps app provides views for:

* Creating, viewing, browsing, editing, and deleting Maps

These operations require the use of GeoServer to manage map rendering, as well
as GeoExt to provide interactive editing and previewing of maps and data layers.

There are also some URL mappings in the ``geonode.maps.urls`` module for easy
inclusion in GeoNode sites.

``settings.py`` Entries
-----------------------

OGC_SERVER
  Default: ``{}`` (Empty dictionary)

  A dictionary of OGC servers and their options.  The main
  server should be listed in the 'default' key.  If there is no 'default'
  key or if the ``OGC_SERVER`` setting does not exist GeoNode will raise
  an Improperly Configured exception.  Below is an example of the ``OGC_SERVER``
  setting::

   OGC_SERVER = {
     'default' : {
         'LOCATION' : 'http://localhost:8080/geoserver/',
         'USER' : 'admin',
         'PASSWORD' : 'geoserver',
     }
   }

  BACKEND
    Default: ``"geonode.geoserver"``

    The OGC server backend to use.  The backend choices are:

    * ``'geonode.geoserver'``

  BACKEND_WRITE_ENABLED
    Default: ``True``

    Specifies whether the OGC server can be written to.  If False, actions that modify
    data on the OGC server will not execute.

  LOCATION
    Default: ``"http://localhost:8080/geoserver/"``

    A base URL from which GeoNode can construct OGC service URLs.
    If using GeoServer you can determine this by
    visiting the GeoServer administration home page without the
    /web/ at the end.  For example, if your GeoServer administration app is at
    http://example.com/geoserver/web/, your server's location is http://example.com/geoserver.

  PUBLIC_LOCATION
    Default: ``"http://localhost:8080/geoserver/"``

    The URL used to in most public requests from GeoNode.  This settings allows a user to write to one OGC server (the LOCATION setting)
    and read from a separate server or the PUBLIC_LOCATION.

  USER
    Default: ``'admin'``

    The administrative username for the OGC server as a string.

  PASSWORD
    Default: ``'geoserver'``

    The administrative password for the OGC server as a string.

  MAPFISH_PRINT_ENABLED
    Default: ``True``

    A boolean that represents whether the MapFish printing extension is enabled on the server.

  PRINT_NG_ENABLED
    Default: ``True``

    A boolean that represents whether printing of maps and layers is enabled.

  GEONODE_SECURITY_ENABLED
    Default: ``True``

    A boolean that represents whether GeoNode's security application is enabled.

  GEOGIT_ENABLED
    Default: ``False``

    A boolean that represents whether the OGC server supports GeoGig datastores.

  WMST_ENABLED
    Default: ``False``

    Not implemented.

  WPS_ENABLED
    Default: ``False``

    Not implemented.

  DATASTORE
    Default: ``''`` (Empty string)

    An optional string that represents the name of a vector datastore that GeoNode uploads
    are imported into.  In order to support vector datastore imports there also needs to be an
    entry for the datastore in the ``DATABASES`` dictionary with the same name.  Example::

     OGC_SERVER = {
       'default' : {
          'LOCATION' : 'http://localhost:8080/geoserver/',
          'USER' : 'admin',
          'PASSWORD' : 'geoserver',
          'DATASTORE': 'geonode_imports'
       }
     }

     DATABASES = {
      'default': {
          'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
          'NAME': 'development.db',
      },
      'geonode_imports' : {
          'ENGINE': 'django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis',
          'NAME': 'geonode_imports',
          'USER' : 'geonode_user',
          'PASSWORD' : 'a_password',
          'HOST' : 'localhost',
          'PORT' : '5432',
       }
      }


GEOSERVER_CREDENTIALS
  Removed in GeoNode 2.0, this value is now specified in the ``OGC_SERVER`` settings.

GEOSERVER_BASE_URL
  Removed in GeoNode 2.0, this value is now specified in the ``OGC_SERVER`` settings.

CATALOGUE
  A dict with the following keys:

  * ENGINE: The CSW backend (default is ``geonode.catalogue.backends.pycsw_local``)
  * URL: The FULLY QUALIFIED base URL to the CSW instance for this GeoNode
  * USERNAME: login credentials (if required)
  * PASSWORD: login credentials (if required)

  pycsw is the default CSW enabled in GeoNode. pycsw configuration directives
  are managed in the PYCSW entry.

PYCSW
  A dict with pycsw's configuration.  Of note are the sections
  ``metadata:main`` to set CSW server metadata and ``metadata:inspire``
  to set INSPIRE options.  Setting ``metadata:inspire['enabled']`` to ``true``
  will enable INSPIRE support.  Server level configurations can be overridden
  in the ``server`` section.  See http://docs.pycsw.org/en/stable/configuration.html
  for full pycsw configuration details.

SITEURL
  Default: ``'http://localhost:8000/'``

  A base URL for use in creating absolute links to Django views.

DEFAULT_MAP_BASE_LAYER
  The name of the background layer to include in newly created maps.
 
DEFAULT_MAP_CENTER
  Default: ``(0, 0)``

  A 2-tuple with the latitude/longitude coordinates of the center-point to use
  in newly created maps.
 
DEFAULT_MAP_ZOOM
  Default: ``0``

  The zoom-level to use in newly created maps.  This works like the OpenLayers
  zoom level setting; 0 is at the world extent and each additional level cuts
  the viewport in half in each direction.

``geonode.proxy`` - Assist JavaScript applications in accessing remote servers
==============================================================================

This Django app provides some HTTP proxies for accessing data from remote
servers, to overcome restrictions imposed by the same-origin policy used by
browsers.  This helps the GeoExt applications in a GeoNode site to access various XML documents from OGC-compliant data services.

Views
-----

geonode.proxy.views.proxy
  This view forwards requests without authentication to a URL provided in the
  request, similar to the proxy.cgi script provided by the OpenLayers project.

geonode.proxy.views.geoserver
  This view proxies requests to GeoServer.  Instead of a URL-encoded URL
  parameter, the path component of the request is expected to be a path
  component for GeoServer.  Requests to this URL require valid authentication
  against the Django site, and will use the default ``OGC_SERVER`` ``USER``,
  ``PASSWORD`` and ``LOCATION`` settings as defined in the maps application.

``geonode.search`` - Provides the GeoNode search functionality.
===============================================================
This Django app provides a fast search functionality to GeoNode.

Views
-----
* search_api- Builds and executes a search query based on URL parameters and returns matching results in requested format.

``geonode.security`` - GeoNode granular Auth Backend
====================================================

This app provides an authentication backend for use in assigning permissions to individual objects (maps and layers).

``settings.py`` Entries
-----------------------

LOCKDOWN_GEONODE
  Default: ``False``

  By default, the GeoNode application allows visitors to view most pages without
  being authenticated.  Set ``LOCKDOWN_GEONODE = True`` to require a user to
  be authenticated before viewing the application.

AUTH_EXEMPT_URLS
  Default: ``()`` (Empty tuple)

  A tuple of URL patterns that the user can visit without being authenticated.
  This setting has no effect if ``LOCKDOWN_GEONODE`` is not True.  For example,
  ``AUTH_EXEMPT_URLS = ('/maps',)`` will allow unauthenticated users to
  browse maps.

Template Tags
-------------
geonode_media <media_name>
  Accesses entries in MEDIA_LOCATIONS without requiring the view to explicitly
  add it to the template context.  Example usage::

  {% include geonode_media %}
  {% geonode_media "ext_base" %}

has_obj_perm <user> <obj> <permission>
  Checks whether the user has the specified permission on an object.

  ``{% has_obj_perm user obj "app.view_thing" as can_view_thing %}``


Django's error templates
========================

GeoNode customizes some of Django's default error templates.

500.html
--------

If no custom handler for 500 errors is set up in urls.py, Django will call django.views.defaults.server_error which expects a 500.html file in the root of the templates directory. In GeoNode, we have put a template that does not inherit from anything as 500.html and because most of Django's machinery is down when an INTERNAL ERROR (500 code) is encountered the use of template tags should be avoided.


3rd party apps
==============

`pinax.notifications`
---------------------

This application enables users to receive notifications from specific events within GeoNode. For user-specific configuration, see :ref:`notifications`. For settings, see :ref:`pinax-notifications`.
