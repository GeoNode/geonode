================================
 Map Management Functional Spec
================================

Overview
========

In version 1.0 of the geonode, the current technology limits map
management to the creation of maps.  It is not possible to edit or
delete an exisiting map.

In 1.5 we would like to expand the map management to cover the full
complement of CRUD capabilities.

User Stories
============

0. Oscar needs to present several views of data uploaded into the
   geonode for a presentation of the outcomes of the CAPRA project. He
   needs to collaborate with experts from GFDRR and ERN to create
   these views.  He has established a workflow where ERN will upload,
   style and compose a series of maps, then he and other GFDRR experts
   will review them, choose the ones that tell the story they want,
   and modify them to work in the presenation.  They will delete the
   maps that that do not use.

   (this usecase implies a possible later feature of "map groups")
