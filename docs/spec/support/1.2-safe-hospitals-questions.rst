====================
 Safe Hospitals Q&C
====================

0. HSI (see `Safe Hospitals Initiative Doc <http://www.searo.who.int/LinkFiles/Hospitals_Safe_from_Disasters_SafeHospitalInitiative.pdf>`_ ) What format and where does the data come from?

   - can it be provided in a format that requires least amount of time
     to deal with?

   - will this data have to interact in any way with the hazard layer data? will that require any server interaction?

   - what format are the HSI "reports" in?

   - seb: What is the difference between "relevant HSI information,"
     the "summary of the HSI report", and the "complete report"?  Are
     there any examples of these reports that we can look at?

0. Data syncronization between PAHO and GeoNode:

   - How? How often? etc.

0. Users: can we talk to them before building?

0. PDF (same questions as myHazard)

0. How is this delivered:
  - UI integration?
  - own application?
 
0. Data entry for Paho
 - can we see current form?
 - what is imagined for the "report updater"

0. User feedback
  - how can we get more user input early?
  - how can manage risk and scope creep?

0. Am I right that this is just about adding a point layer with points that
  - return a link to HSI/PAHO on GetFeatureInfo
  - when clicked, trigger a 2nd GetFeatureInfo request for the myHazard report on the point's location?

0. What does updating the HSI information involve?
  - synchronization (script based)
  - or manual (WFS-T based via the UI)
