''Attendees'': Cholmes, Stu, Oscar, Seb, Rollie, Whit

== Agenda ==
 - Reporting (myHazard & Safe Hospitals; see: http://etherpad.com/PMolwJQpjR )
 - Validation / Certification
 - GeoNode.org (see: http://etherpad.com/W1zABCKWe8 )
 - Uploading and Styling (Discussed 20090922)
== Strategy and Background ==

Jean Roch (SIDR)
 - SNIT GeoNode
 - 'GeoNode' in Guatamala adds credibility

INSPIRE
 - Stu spoke to head of INSPIRE about GeoNode
 - Thinking of testing their 'next-generation' system on this platform

ITC ( http://www.itc.nl/ )
 - Meeting in Netherlands about geoinformation for disaster risk management
   - Oscar traveling to this event
 - Do training and capacity-building around geospatial and SDI stuff
   - http://www.itc.nl/Pub/Research/Research-themes/SDIT
   - OpenGeo Traning Partner?
     - Using CC-licensed "OpenGeo Certified" training material
     - Meeting in DC in early October, send an OpenGeo rep?*
 - Create professional networks across the developing world
 - UN Spider and GEOSS also attending
   - GEOSS working on several portals and pilots (eg, Caribbean flood pilot)
   - GEOSS attempting to see how people use geospatial data

New national SDIs: Australia, Korea
 - Stu chasing Korean money
 - Australia
   - Cholmes: Aussies committing back complex features work to GeoServer*
   - Could be interested in exploring geospatial licensing issues...
     - Some government in Australia using CC*
     - LandGate?

== Validation and Certification ==

Guatemala/Colombia Cadastral Data
 - Workflows leveraging relationship between national GeoNode and municipal GeoNodes
 - Validating and '''certifying''' against OpenStreetMap
   - Interface OSM with local government system (eg, municipal GeoNode)
   - Feedback up to OSM as well, workflow unclear
     - Review every commit? General benchmarks (pegged to revisions?), etc
     - Certify revisions? Certify committers?
     - Similar to USGS Hydrography project?
   - "One of the main things behind the Korean money..." -Stu
   - "All you have to do is install a GeoNode to get these benefits" - Stu
   - "The governments aren't going to collect the data, we need an existing community like OSM and just have the government certify it so we can use it." - Stu
 - "In Central America we have to start at the national level... in Colombia we can work at the local level." - Oscar

 - Political concerns:
   - We have various governments and UN agencies on board...
     - Spain, Guatamala
   - What technical communities need to get on board?
   - "Easier to say 'We support OGC' than vice versa." - Cholmes
   - Get OSM onboard?
     - Official validation of OSM would be a good win for them.
     - License issues with OSM?
   - Licensing issues
     - We need Open GeoData License, can World Bank help?

 - GeoNode in a box
   - Needs to be as compelling at the ESRI out-of-the-box solution
 - GeoNode vendors
   - Get implementation partners on board

== Uploading and Styling ==

Meeting on 20090922
''Attendees'': Stu, Seb, Rollie, Whit

 1. Data management & cartography
    - Goal: Get ERN-LA able to push data to GeoNode themselves
    - Upload
      - Shapefile, TIFF
      - AME?
        - Upload to web server
        - Populate the list of AMEs
        - Manage metadata for each AME
      - First round: backend uploading support for one generalized user
      - Next round: support for multiple user accounts
    - Data management
      - Managing data
        - Layer page
          - See older wireframes: http://projects.opengeo.org/CAPRA/attachment/wiki/WikiStart/20090722%20Resource.png
          - Create demo page of future work
        - Deleting
          - Maintaining map coherence
            - Remove layer from all maps?
            - Hide from future maps?
          - Replace (eg, canonical 100 year return period)
        - Category management: Hazard, Risk, Overlay
          - For myHazard; for Safe Hospitals
            - Can backend work be moved into current contract?*
      - Managing maps
          - Deleting

            - Contributed map
      - Metadata
        - GeoServer vs ISO
        - Requires GeoNetwork integration?
        - GeoServer doesn't implement ISO metadata standards
        - World Bank requires ISO subset*
      - Styling
        - Basic vector and raster
          - Raster more important than vector
          - Simple colors, transparency
        - New, edit, duplicate (and edit), delete, download
        - Base layers (use widget from myHazard)
        - Support for multiple styles per layer
          - Including in the map composer
            - Manual transparency in composer

        - Safe Hospitals
          - The hospitals layer
          - Split off UI
 2. Integration of GeoNetwork & Search
    - Compliance with ISO metadata standards
      - World Bank prioritizes subset of ISO
    - Search (as a context for download)
    - Integration with GeoNetwork
      - Nice to have...
      - Access to other GeoNetwork data from CAPRA
      - Exposure to other GeoNetwork nodes for harvesting
      - Have GeoNetwork as part of deployment
      - http://geonetwork-opensource.org/geonetwork-nodes
 3. Deployment plan
    - A document describing the deployment needs
    - Determine what capacity is needed in the field
    - Long term plan for splitting out PAHO (Safe Hospitals) GeoNode
      - PAHO ownership of admin tasks
      - Point at CAPRA GeoNode data
 4. UI Improvements
    - Create map from multiple selected layers
