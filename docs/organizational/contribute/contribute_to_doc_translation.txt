How to Translate the Documentation
==================================

All documentation is written in English as the master language but can be translated into your native language.
This write up will show you how to translate the documentation.  There are different methods to translate the
documentation and here we list a few.

Translate using Github Locally
==============================

Here we assume you have github running locally and that you are familiar with the command line.

#. Get latest version from Github:

   .. code-block:: console

    $ git pull


#. Get latest version from transifex
   (it should be synced with Github, but just in case):

   .. code-block:: console

    $ tx pull -a


#. Edit your files
   for example (if using vi):

   .. code-block:: console

    $ vi i18n/it/LC_MESSAGES/index.po

#. Build the documentation
   now, before committing and pushing, build the doc to see if everything worked smoothly:

   .. code-block:: console

    $ make html LANG=it

#. Push changes
   if everything worked well, push the changes:

   .. code-block:: console

    $ tx push -s -t
