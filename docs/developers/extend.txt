Extending GeoNode
=================

This page provides a high-level description of what have emerged as "Best
Practices" for extending or building on top of the GeoNode platform. While 
there are other ways to accomplish this, several key existing projects 
(see below) now follow this methodology after much trial-and-error, and it's 
now agreed to be the *best* way to extend from GeoNode in order to add 
functionality or to customize the site. 

.. TODO: Some notes here about the goal of easily upgrading to new GeoNode Releases

Existing Projects using this Methodology
========================================
* Risiko (https://github.com/AIFDR/riab)
* TsuDAT (https://github.com/aifdr/tsudat2)
* HaitiData (https://github.com/GFDRR/haitidata)
* OpenRDI (https://github.com/GFDRR/openrdi)
* OpenSanDiego Maps (https://github.com/ortelius/mapsosd)

Pre-requisites
==============

* Working GeoNode installation see :doc:`/intro/install`. 
* Familiarity with Django and its project layout scheme 
  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/ 


Setup Steps
===========

1. *Upgrade GeoNode:* First and foremost, you should upgrade GeoNode to the
   latest release. GeoNode releases can be found here 
   http://dev.geonode.org/release/ There are deployment scripts that make
   this process much easier.

2. *Activate GeoNode's virtualenv:* While your new project will be a Django
   project in it own right, it needs to have access to all the dependencies
   you already installed as part of GeoNode into a virtual environment. 
   You can *activate* that virtual environment and make 
   those dependencies available with the following command::

     $ source /var/lib/geonode/bin/activate

   This may need to be modified if you installed in a non-standard location.

3. *Setup Your Project Directory:* Your new project needs to follow Django's
   conventions for a project, and this is most easily accomplished by using
   Django's management commands specifically setup for this purpose. To use
   these commands, change directories into the place where you want your
   project to live and issue the following command, replacing 
   <your_project_name> with the name for your new project:: 
   
     $ django-admin.py startproject <your_project_name>
   
   It is recommended that you immediately place your project under revision
   control, and it's further recommended that you use Git and GitHub. Once
   your project is created with the startproject management command, you can
   setup your project in github by following the instructions here. 
   http://help.github.com/create-a-repo/ 

4. *Copy key files from GeoNode into your project dir:* Once your new Django
   project is setup, you need to copy some key files from GeoNode into your
   projects top level directory. Change directories into the new directory
   created by the startproject management command and issue the following
   commands::

     $ cp /var/lib/geonode/src/GeoNodePy/geonode/settings.py . 
     $ cp /var/lib/geonode/src/GeoNodePy/geonode/local_settings.py . 
     $ cp /var/lib/geonode/src/GeoNodePy/geonode/urls.py . 

   You will be modifying these files as part of the process of extending
   GeoNode or customizing it for your own purposes.
   
5. *Modify settings.py file:* The first file that needs to be modified is the
   main settings file. You need to add a few lines to it in order to make
   it suitable for use in your project.

   Basic Settings::

     import geonode
   
     PROJECT_ROOT = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))
     GEONODE_ROOT = os.path.dirname(geonode.__file__) 

   Media settings:: 

     MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, "uploads")
     MEDIA_URL = "/uploads/"
     GEONODE_UPLOAD_PATH = os.path.join(MEDIA_ROOT, "geonode")
     STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, "static")
     STATIC_URL = "/static/"
     GEONODE_CLIENT_LOCATION = STATIC_URL + "geonode/"
     ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX = os.path.join(STATIC_URL, "admin/")
     STATICFILES_DIRS = [
        os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, "media"),
        os.path.join(GEONODE_ROOT, "media"),
     ]

   Template Directories:: 
   
     TEMPLATE_DIRS = (
       os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT,"templates"),
       os.path.join(GEONODE_ROOT,"templates"),
     )

   GEOSERVER_TOKEN

6. *Install dependencies for your project:* If your project requires additional
   dependencies that are not installed as part of GeoNode, you should create a
   requirements.txt file and include them inside. A requirements.txt file is
   simply a text file that includes the name of a library or app that can be
   installed with easy_install or pip. Documentation on the requirements file
   format can be found here http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/#requirements-files 
   An example is below::

     django-rosetta
     django-flatblocks
     django-modeltranslation

   When the requirements file is in place, and the virtualenv is activated
   (see step 2 above), you can install the additional dependencies with the
   following command::

     $ pip install -e requirements.txt 

   If any of these requirements are django apps (as in the above example),
   they need to be added to the INSTALLED_APPS section of your settings.py
   file::

      INSTALLED_APPS = (
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.sites',
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles',
        'django_extensions',
        'registration',
        'profiles',
        'avatar',
        'geonode.core',
        'geonode.maps',
        'geonode.proxy',
        'rosetta',
        'flatblocks',
        'modeltranslation',
     )

7. *Syncdb:* If the additional dependencies you have installed in the steps above
   are django apps that will use the Django ORM to store and retrieve data in
   a database, you need to execute the syncdb management command to create the
   tables in the database. This can be done with the following command::

     $ python manage.py syncdb

8. *Copy GeoNodes wsgi script and modify it for your project:* The GeoNode application
   is executed and served apache using a wsgi launcher script. You will need to make
   a copy of this launcher script and modify it to execute your newly created project.
   This can be done with the following commands::

     $ cd /var/www/geonode/wsgi
     $ cp geonode.wsgi <new_project_name>.wsgi

   Replacing <new_project_name> with the name of your newly created project.

   Once this file is in place, it needs to be modified to execute your new project when
   being run via apache. The existing line that specifies which settings module to use should be modified
   to point at your settings. <new_project_name> should be replaced by the name of your
   new project::

     os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = '<new_project_name>.settings'
   
8. *Configure apache to use your own wsgi script:* Once your new wsgi launcher script is
   modified and ready for use, you need to setup apache to use this script instead of the
   original geonode one. Depending on your platform, the file containing the WSGIScriptAlias
   directive will vary. Please consult the :doc:`/intro/install` documentation. This directive
   should be modified to point at your newly created wsgi script::

     WSGIScriptAlias / "/var/www/geonode/wsgi/<new_project_name>.wsgi"

   Replacing <new_project_name> with the name of your project.

9. *Begin Customizing/Extending:* You are now ready to begin modifying GeoNode to extend
   or customize it. You may need to redo some of the steps above if you need to add new
   dependencies or change directives in the settings.py file.


Types of Customization/Extension
================================

Branding
--------

The section :doc:`/deploy/customize` describes how to change the Logo, Colors and other branding elements in a GeoNode site.

.. TODO::
   Add the following two sections:

    1. Adding Additional Django Pluggable Apps
    2. Adding your own Django Apps

Geoprocessing
-------------

The Process extension to GeoServer helps to define custom geoprocessing
operations against data managed by GeoServer.  The operations are exposed 
via a GeoServer RESTlet endpoint.

Some processes are included with the Process extension.  Defining your own
processes is possible too, but first let's look at how to use the processes
that are already present.

There are two 'modes' of accessing these processes: *interactive* and *batch*.
The *interactive* mode is appropriate for fast-running processes and returns
the result of the operation as the HTTP response to the request that launches
the process.  The *batch* mode starts a thread on the server and supports
polling to find out information about progress until the process is completed.

Interactive Mode Processing
...........................

To use interactive-mode processing: 

  * send an HTTP POST request with the process parameters to
    /geoserver/rest/process/{process}/ .  The parameters must be formatted as a
    JSON document.

  * The result of the process will be returned, or an error will be reported
    via the HTTP status code (500 for a general error, 400 for a badly
    formatted request, etc.)  While the format of this response varies with the
    process, JSON should be preferred for structured, machine-accessible
    responses.

Batch Mode Processing
.....................

To use batch-mode processing:

  * send an HTTP POST with the process parameters to
    /geoserver/rest/process/{process}/launch .  The parameters must be
    formatted as a JSON document as described in the section on interactive
    mode.  The reponse will contain a document describing the process's
    progress, including an {id} string that identifies the process for future
    reference.

  * The process will initially be in a queue.  You can check on its progress by
    sending an HTTP GET request to /geoserver/rest/processes/{id}/status .
    When the status is DONE, you can send an HTTP GET request to
    /geoserver/rest/processes/{id}/result.

  * If you find a reason to cancel (for example, the user closes the JS widget
    that launched the process request), you can cancel by sending a DELETE
    request to /geoserver/rest/processes/{id} .  This will free up resources
    sooner, but in either case GeoServer will automatically delete cached
    process results after a set period, so you should ensure that you present
    the results to the user in a prompt fashion via some means or other.

Custom Processes
................

To create a custom process:

#. Write a Java class that extends the Process interface.  It can use GeoTools,
   and has access to the GeoServer catalog.  Let's call it
   ``com.example.custom.Process``.  Aditionally, subclass ``ProcessRestlet`` to
   create a Restlet that invokes your Process.

#. Include a Spring context XML file called ``applicationContext.xml`` that
   defines a bean using your process class, and a restlet mapping that attaches
   your process to a specific URL pattern.  An example would be:

   .. code-block:: xml

       <beans>
         <bean class="com.example.custom.ProcessRestlet" id="exampleRestlet"/>
         <bean class="org.geoserver.rest.RESTMapping" id="exampleMapping">
           <property name="routes">
             <map>
               <entry>
                 <key><value>/process/example</value></key>
                 <value>exampleRestlet</value>
               </entry>
             </map>
         </bean>
       </beans>

#. Make sure that the JAR containing your process is on the Java classpath when
   your application is running by including it in the ``WEB-INF/lib`` directory 
   of your GeoServer WAR file.
