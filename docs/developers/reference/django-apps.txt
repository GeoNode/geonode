GeoNode Django Apps
===================

The user interface of a GeoNode site is built on top of the Django web
framework.  GeoNode includes a few "apps" (reusable Django modules) to support
development of those user interfaces.  While these apps have reasonable default
configurations, for customized GeoNode sites you will probably want to adjust
these apps for your specific needs.

      geonode.security
        Provide django auth backend for providing security system. 
  
      geonode.maps
        manage layers, maps, styles
  
      geonode.proxy
        support JavaScript applications accessing GeoServer/GeoNetwork

``geonode.security`` - GeoNode granular Auth Backend 
====================================================

This app provides a Granular (object level) Django Auth backend for use
in assigning permissions to individual objects (maps and layers).

``settings.py`` Entries
-----------------------

MEDIA_LOCATIONS
  GeoNode uses a lot of JavaScript and CSS includes due to the distribution
  restrictions imposed by ExtJS.  The MEDIA_LOCATIONS settings file should be a
  Python dict providing mappings from abstracted library prefixes to actual
  media URLs, suitable for use in the site.  To see the prefix names used in
  the default templates, an example, consult the settings.py for the example
  ``geonode`` site included in the source tree.

Template Tags
-------------
geonode_media <media_name>
  Accesses entries in MEDIA_LOCATIONS without requiring the view to explicitly
  add it to the template context.  Example usage::

  {% include geonode_media %}
  {% geonode_media "ext_base" %}

``geonode.maps`` - Map creation and geospatial data management
==============================================================

This Django app provides some support for managing and manipulating geospatial
datasets.  In particular, it provides tools for editing, viewing, and searching
metadata for data layers, and for editing, viewing, and searching maps that
aggregate data layers to display data about a particular topic.

Models
------

The maps app provides two main model types:

* Layer - A data layer managed by the GeoNode

* Map - A collection of data layers composed in a particular order to form a map

Additionally, there is a MapLayer model that maintains some map-specific
information related to a layer, such as the z-indexing order.

Views
-----

The maps app provides views for:

* Creating, viewing, browsing, editing, and deleting Maps
* Creating, viewing, browsing, editing, and deleting Layers and their metadata

These operations require the use of GeoServer and GeoNetwork to manage map
rendering and metadata indexing, as well as GeoExt to provide interactive
editing and previewing of maps and data layers.

There are also some url mappings in the geonode.maps.urls module for easy
inclusion in GeoNode sites.

``settings.py`` Entries
-----------------------

GEOSERVER_CREDENTIALS 
  A 2-tuple with the username and password for a user with privileges to manage
  data in the GeoServer coupled to this GeoNode.

GEOSERVER_BASE_URL
  A base URL from which GeoNode can construct GeoServer service URLs.  This is
  the servlet context URL for the servlet container, or you can determine it by
  visiting the GeoServer administration app's home page without the /web/ at
  the end.  If your GeoServer administration app is at
  http://example.com/geoserver/web/ , your GEOSERVER_BASE_URL is
  http://example.com/ .

GEONETWORK_CREDENTIALS
  Similar to GEOSERVER_CREDENTIALS, but for GeoNetwork.  The user must have
  permissions to create and modify metadata records in GeoNetwork.

GEONETWORK_BASE_URL
  Similar to GEOSERVER_BASE_URL, but for GeoNetwork.  Again, this is the
  servlet context URL, or can be determined by stripping the last path
  component off the url for the GeoNetwork homepage.

SITEURL
  A base URL for use in creating absolute links to Django views.

DEFAULT_MAP_BASE_LAYER
  The name of the background layer to include in newly created maps.
 
DEFAULT_MAP_CENTER
  A 2-tuple with the latitude/longitude coordinates of the center-point to use
  in newly created maps.
 
DEFAULT_MAP_ZOOM
  The zoom-level to use in newly created maps.  This works like the OpenLayers
  zom level setting; 0 is at the world extent and each additional level cuts
  the viewport in half in each direction.
  
GOOGLE_API_KEY
  A Google Maps v2 API key to use when a Google Maps background layer is used.


``django-admin.py`` Commands
----------------------------

updatelayers
  Scan GeoServer for data that hasn't been added to the GeoNode yet, and ensure
  that each layer in the Django database is indexed in GeoNetwork

``geonode.proxy`` - Assist JavaScript applications in accessing remote servers
==============================================================================

This Django app provides some HTTP proxies for accessing data from remote
servers, to overcome restrictions imposed by the same-origin policy used by
browsers.  This helps the GeoExt applications in a GeoNode site to access various XML documents from OGC-compliant data services.

Views
-----

geonode.proxy.views.proxy
  This view forwards requests without authentication to a URL provided in the
  request, similar to the proxy.cgi script provided by the OpenLayers project.

geonode.proxy.views.geoserver
  This view proxies requests to GeoServer.  Instead of a URL-encoded URL
  parameter, the path component of the request is expected to be a path
  component for GeoServer.  Requests to this URL require valid authentication
  against the Django site, and will use the GEOSERVER_CREDENTIALS and
  GEOSERVER_BASE_URL settings as defined in the maps application.
