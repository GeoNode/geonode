JavaScript in GeoNode
=====================

GeoNode provides a number of facilities for interactivity in the web browser built on top of several high-quality JavaScript frameworks:

* `ExtJS <http://extjs.com/>`_ for component-based UI construction and data
  access
* `OpenLayers <http://openlayers.org/>`_ for interactive mapping and other
  geospatial operations
* `GeoExt <http://geoext.org/>`_ for integrating ExtJS with OpenLayers
* `GXP <http://projects.opengeo.org/gxp>`_ for providing some higher-level
  application building facilities on top of GeoExt, as well as improving
  integration with GeoServer.
* and a GeoNode-specific framework to handle some pages and services that are
  unique to GeoNode.

The following concepts are particularly important for developing on top of the
GeoNode's JavaScript framework.

* Components - Ext components handle most interactive functionality in
  "regular" web pages.  For example, the scrollable/sortable/filterable table
  on the default Search page is a Grid component.  While GeoNode does use some
  custom components, familiarity with the idea of Components used by ExtJS is
  applicable in GeoNode development.

* Viewers - Viewers display interactive maps in web pages, optionally decorated
  with Ext controls for toolbars, layer selection, etc.  Viewers in GeoNode use
  the GeoExplorer base class, which builds on top of GXP's Viewer to provide
  some common functionality such as respecting site-wide settings for
  background layers. Viewers can be used as components embedded in pages, or
  they can be full-page JavaScript applications.

* Controls - Controls are tools for use in OpenLayers maps (such as a freehand
  control for drawing new geometries onto a map, or an identify control for
  getting information about individual features on a map.)  GeoExt provides
  tools for using these controls as ExtJS "Actions" - operations that can be
  invoked as buttons or menu options or associated with other events.
