Architecture Overview
=====================

This section provides insight about the components of GeoNode and the way they are used to create the final product.

Components
==========

The main components are:

#. **The GeoSpatial Data Manager: GeoServer**

    GeoServer provides an *OGC* compatible data store that can speak *WMS*, *WFS*, *WCS* and others in common formats like *GML*, *GeoJSON*, *KML* and *GeoTiff*.

    It can be connected to different spatial backends including *PostGIS*, *Oracle Spatial*, *ArcSDE* and others.

#. **The Catalog: GeoNetwork**

    GeoNetwork provides a standard catalog and search interface based on *OGC* standards.

    It is used via the *CSW* interface to create and update records when they are accessed in GeoNode..

#. **The Website: GeoNode Django Site**

    This is a Django based project that allows the user to easily tweak the content and look and feel and to extend GeoNode to build Geospatial.

    It includes tools to handle user registration and accounts, avatars, and helper libraries to interact with GeoServer and GeoNetwork in a programatic and integrated way.

    There is a wide range of third party apps that can be plugged into a GeoNode based site including tools to connect to different social networks, to build content management systems and more.


#. **The Map Composer: GeoNode Client**

    The main map interface for GeoNode is the Map Composer / Editor. It is built on top of *GeoExt* and uses OPenLayers, GXP

    It talks to the other components via *HTTP* and *JSON* as well as standard *OGC* services.

GeoNode and GeoServer
=====================

GeoNode uses GeoServer to convert geographic data between various file formats,
as well as render styled map tiles.  While standard GeoServer components,
including its OGC-compliant web services and REST configuration API, provide
the bulk of the GeoServer functionality used in a GeoNode site, there are some
extensions to help GeoServer and the Django application interoperate more
better.

Authentication/Authorization
----------------------------

GeoNode provides an extension to GeoServer to have it respect GeoNode's
user database and permissions instead of its own independent system 
(essentially delegating its security handling to GeoNode).  This
extension allows GeoServer to authenticate users by HTTP Basic auth (good for
general desktop GIS applications) or Django session cookies (good for users
accessing GeoServer from the Django site.)  The basic strategy is for GeoServer
to forward either type of credential to a Django web service which provides
GeoServer with up-to-date information about the user's permissions.  Consider a
request coming into some GeoServer service::

    GET /geoserver/ows?request=GetFeature&typename=top_secret:data

GeoServer will first inspect the request to identify whether it contains an
``Authorization:`` header or a cookie from the Django session system.
GeoServer then issues a request to Django::

    GET /data/acls
   
Including the credentials it found on the initial request.  If the
``Authorization:`` header contains the username and password for a valid user,
or the session cookie corresponds to an active session for a logged-in user,
then Django responds with a document describing the permissions associated with
that user.  If the ``Authorization:`` header or cookie is found and determined
to be invalid, then Django sets a 401 status on the HTTP response.  Otherwise,
Django assumes an anonymous user and returns a document describing the
permissions associated with anonymous users.  The permissions document is a
JSON object that looks like this::

    {
        "is_superuser": false,
        "rw": [],
        "ro": [
            "geonode:medford_parks",
            "geonode:medford_zoning"
        ],
        "is_anonymous": false,
        "name": "foo"
    }

That is, a top-level object with five keys:

``is_superuser``
  Specifies whether the user has superuser status (as specified in the Django Database). Superusers have full permissions to **all** layers and maps.

``rw``
    an array of prefixed layer names of layers which should be fully available
    (both read and write) to this user

``ro``
    an array of prefixed layer names of layers which should be displayed to this
    user, but which he/she should not be able to modify

``is_anonymous``
  Specifies whether the user is an anonymous (un-authenticated user).

``name``
  Specifies the username for an authenticated user. 

All layers not named in this response will be presumed fully restricted, that
is, neither modifiable nor visible to the user in question.


GeoNode and GeoNetwork

Customizing the schema used in GeoNetwork

  * adapt Layer metadata in Django, analogous to Django's usual User models

JavaScript in GeoNode
=====================

GeoNode provides a number of facilities for interactivity in the web browser built on top of several high-quality JavaScript frameworks:

* `ExtJS <http://extjs.com/>`_ for component-based UI construction and data
  access
* `OpenLayers <http://openlayers.org/>`_ for interactive mapping and other
  geospatial operations
* `GeoExt <http://geoext.org/>`_ for integrating ExtJS with OpenLayers
* `GXP <http://projects.opengeo.org/gxp>`_ for providing some higher-level
  application building facilities on top of GeoExt, as well as improving
  integration with GeoServer.
* and a GeoNode-specific framework to handle some pages and services that are
  unique to GeoNode.

The following concepts are particularly important for developing on top of the
GeoNode's JavaScript framework.

* **Components** - Ext components handle most interactive functionality in
  "regular" web pages.  For example, the scrollable/sortable/filterable table
  on the default Search page is a Grid component.  While GeoNode does use some
  custom components, familiarity with the idea of Components used by ExtJS is
  applicable in GeoNode development.

* **Viewers** - Viewers display interactive maps in web pages, optionally decorated
  with Ext controls for toolbars, layer selection, etc.  Viewers in GeoNode use
  the GeoExplorer base class, which builds on top of GXP's Viewer to provide
  some common functionality such as respecting site-wide settings for
  background layers. Viewers can be used as components embedded in pages, or
  they can be full-page JavaScript applications.

* **Controls** - Controls are tools for use in OpenLayers maps (such as a freehand
  control for drawing new geometries onto a map, or an identify control for
  getting information about individual features on a map.)  GeoExt provides
  tools for using these controls as ExtJS "Actions" - operations that can be
  invoked as buttons or menu options or associated with other events.
