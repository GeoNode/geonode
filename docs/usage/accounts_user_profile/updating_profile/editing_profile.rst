Editing Profile Information
===========================

Your *Profile* contains personal information such as your address, your telephone number, your organization and so on but it is empty by default at the beginning.

Through the :guilabel:`Edit profile` button of the *Profile* page (see :ref:`editing-profile`) you can set your details, including your avatar.
