Accounts and User Profile
=========================

In GeoNode many contents are public so unregistered users have read-only access to public maps, layers and documents.
In order to create maps, add layers or documents, edit the data and share these resources with other users, you need to sign in.

GeoNode is primarily a *social* platform, thus a primary component of any GeoNode instance is the user account.

This section will guide you through account registration, updating your account information and preferences, connections with social networks and email addresses.
