====

Data management tools built into GeoNode allow for integrated creation of data, documents, link to external documents, and map visualizations.
Each dataset in the system can be shared publicly or restricted to allow access to only specific users.
Social features like user profiles and commenting and rating systems allow for the development of communities around each platform to facilitate the use, management, and quality control of the data the GeoNode instance contains.

The following sections will explain more in depth what data can be managed in GeoNode and how to easily find that data.
