Downloading Layers
==================

| At the top of the *Layer Page* there is the :guilabel:`Download Layer` button (see :ref:`layer-info`). It provides access to the ability to extract geospatial data from within GeoNode.
| You will see a list of options of the supported export formats. You can choose the *Images* formats ``PNG``, ``PDF``, ``JPEG`` if you want to save a "screenshot-like" image of the layer.
