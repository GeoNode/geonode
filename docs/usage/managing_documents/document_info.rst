Document Information
====================

From the *Documents Search Page* (see :ref:`finding-documents`) you can select the document you are interested in and see some basic information about it. You can access the document details page by clicking on its name.
That page looks like the one shown in the picture below.

    *Document Information page*

On the page of a document, the resource is either directly displayed on the page or accessible by clicking on the link provided under the title.

Exploring the Tabs Sections
---------------------------

There is a *Tab Section* below the document, where you can first view *Info* about the document.

The **Info Tab** section shows the document metadata such as its title, abstract, date of publication etc. The metadata also indicates the user who is responsible for uploading and managing this content, as well as the group to which it is linked.

The **Share Tab** provides the social media links for the document to share. There is also a link to share the document through email.

GeoNode also supports the *EXIF (EXchangeable Image Format)* for ``jpeg`` and ``tiff`` image documents.
The *EXIF* means that additional information (metadata) are stored within the image, so GeoNode allows you to see those information in the **Exif Tab**.
