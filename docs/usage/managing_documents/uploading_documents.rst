Uploading Documents
===================

GeoNode allows to share reports, conceptual notes, posters, spreadsheets, etc. A wide range of documents files can be hosted on the platform, including text files (.doc, .docx, .txt, .odt), spreadsheets (.xls, .xlsx, .ods), presentations (.ppt, .pptx, .odp), images (.gif, .jpg, .png, .tif, .tiff), PDF, zip files (.rar, .zip, .gz), SLD, XML or QML files.

.. warning:: Only authenticated users can upload data into GeoNode.

*Documents* uploading is accessible from two positions:

* the :guilabel:`Upload Documents` button of the *Documents Search* page (see :ref:`finding-documents`)

#. insert the title of the document
#. select one or more published resources the document can be linked to (optional)

At the end of the uploading process you will be driven to the *Metadata* page to fill out other information about the document. See the next section to know more about that.
