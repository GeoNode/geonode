Contacting other users
======================

| GeoNode allows you to communicate by message with other registered users and groups.
| To send a message to some user and/or groups you can follow the link :guilabel:`Message User` from your *Profile* page (see :ref:`editing-profile`) or from the *Profile* details page (see the previous section :ref:`user-info`) of that user.
