GeoNode Admins Guide
====================

GeoNode has an administration panel, based on the Django admin, which can be used to do some database operations.
Although most of the operations can and should be done through the normal GeoNode interface,
the admin panel provides a quick overview and management tool over the database.

The following sections will explain more in depth what functionalities the admin panel makes you available.
It should be highlighted that the sections not covered in this guide are meant to be managed through GeoNode UI.
