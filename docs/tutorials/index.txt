Tutorials
=========

The tutorials are based around performing tasks, like adding data or publishing maps.
The tutorials are written in a workshop-like format, and are broken into three
groups: *Users*, *Administrators* and *Developers*.

:ref:`users`
    In the *users* workshop you will learn how to create an account on GeoNode,
    add layers and maps to your account, as well as publishing them.

:ref:`admin`
    The *administrators* workshop will guide you through the installation and
    configuration of GeoNode, as well as explore further possibilities with
    GeoNode.

:ref:`devel`
    The *developers* workshop will show you how to set up your own GeoNode
    project, start developing, customizing, integrating, bug fixing, etc.
