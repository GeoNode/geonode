Tutorials
=========

The tutorials are based around performing tasks, like adding data or publishing maps. The tutorials are written in a workshop like format and are broken into three groups *Users*, *Administrators* and *Developers*.

.. An Ubuntu 14.04 based Virtual Machine, containing the base packages and data for the execution of the workshop exercises, is available for download `here <https://www.dropbox.com/s/sucj3pb36qqhav3/GeoNode%20-%20Training%20-%20v1.4.zip?dl=0>`_
    The Virtual Machine can be launched through `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_ or `VMWare Player <http://www.vmware.com/>`_ binaries.
    
    The users to be used with the Virtual Machine are:
    
    .. code-block:: yaml
    
        geo/geo # principal user with sudoers privileges
        geonode/geo # /home/geonode is the location where you can find sources, binaries and training data
        postgres/postgres # system user for the management of the DBMS

:ref:`overview_and_ref`
    This module guides the user to an overview of GeoNode and its main components.

    At the end of this section you will have a clear view of what GeoNode is and can do.
    You will be able also to use the GeoNode main functionalities and understand some of
    the basic concepts of the system infrastructure.

:ref:`installation_and_admin`
    This module is more oriented to users having some System Administrator background.

    At the end of this section you will be able to setup from scratch the whole GeoNode infrastructure and understand how to the different pieces are interconnected and which are their dependencies.

        7. Apache HTTPD Server and WSGI Python bindings

:ref:`users_workshop`
    This workshop will teach how to use the GeoNode going in depth into what we can do with software application.
    At the end of this section you will master all the GeoNode sections and entities from a user perspective. 

    You will know how to:

    1. Manage users accounts and how to modify them.
    2. Use and manage the different GeoNode basic resources.
    3. Use the GeoNode searching tools to find your resources.
    4. Manage Layers and Maps, update the styles and publish them.
    5. Load datasets into GeoNode and keep them synchronized with GeoServer.

    *Prerequisites*
        Before proceeding with the reading, it is strongly recommended to be sure having clear the following concepts:

        1. GeoNode and Django framework basic concepts
        2. What is Python
        3. What is a geospatial server and a basic knowledge of the geospatial web services.
        4. What is a metadata and a catalog.
        5. What is a map and a legend.

:ref:`admin_workshop`
    This workshop will teach how to install and manage a deployment of the `GeoNode <http://geonode.org/>`_ software application.
    At the end of this section you will master all the GeoNode sections and entities from an administrator perspective. 

    You will know how to:

    1. Use the GeoNode’s Django Administration Panel.
    2. Use the console Management Commands for GeoNode.
    3. Configure and customize your GeoNode installation.

    *Prerequisites*

:ref:`dev_workshop`
    This workshop will teach how to develop with and for the `GeoNode <http://geonode.org>`_ software application.
    This module will introduce you to the components that GeoNode is built with, the standards that it supports and the services it provides based on those standards, and an overview its architecture.

    *Prerequisites*
        GeoNode is a web based GIS tool, and as such, in order to do development on GeoNode itself or to integrate it into your own application, you should be familiar with basic web development concepts as well as with general GIS concepts.

:ref:`adv_workshop`
    This module introduces advanced techniques and methodologies for the management of the geospatial data and the maintenance and tuning of the servers on *Production Environments*.
    
    The last sections of the module will teach also you how to add brand new classes and functionalities to your GeoNode installation.
    
    *Prerequisites*
        You should be familiar with GeoNode, GeoServer, Python framework and
development concepts other than with system administrator and caching concepts and techniques.
