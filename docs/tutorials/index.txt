=========

The tutorials are based around performing tasks, like adding data or publishing maps. The tutorials are written in a workshop like format and are broken into three groups *Users*, *Administrators* and *Developers*.

.. hint:: An Ubuntu 14.04 based Virtual Machine, containing the base packages and data for the execution of the workshop exercises, is available for download `here <https://www.dropbox.com/s/sucj3pb36qqhav3/GeoNode%20-%20Training%20-%20v1.4.zip?dl=0>`_
    The Virtual Machine can be launched through `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_ or `VMWare Player <http://www.vmware.com/>`_ binaries.
    
    The users to be used with the Virtual Machine are:
    
    .. code-block:: yaml
    
        geo/geo # principal user whith suoders privileges
        geonode/geo # /home/geonode is the location where you can find sources, binaries and training data
        postgres/postgres # system user for the management of the DBMS

    *Prerequisites*
        GeoNode is a web based GIS tool, and as such, in order to do development on GeoNode itself or to integrate it into your own application, you should be familiar with basic web development concepts as well as with general GIS concepts.

:ref:`adv_workshop`
    This module introduces advanced tecquinques and metodologies for the management of the geospatial data and the maintenance and tuning of the servers on *Production Environments*.
    
    The last sections of the module will teach also you how to add brand new classes and functionalities to your GeoNode installation.
    
    *Prerequisites*
        You should be familiar with GeoNode, GeoServer, Python framework and development concepts other than with system administrator and caching concepts and tecnquiques.
