Manage the maps using the admin panel
=====================================

Currently the maps admin panel allows more metadata options that the GeoNode maps metadata page. Thus is a good place where to add some more detailed information.

The "Map Layers" section should not be used.

By clicking on a map in the maps list the metadata web form will be presented.
Is possible to add or modify the information here. As for the layers, the more specific entries like the layers stack or the map coordinates should not be modified.
