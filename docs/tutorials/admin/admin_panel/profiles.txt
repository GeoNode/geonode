Manage profiles using the admin panel
=====================================

So far GeoNode implements two distinct roles, that can be assigned to resources such as layers, maps or documents:

* party who authored the resource
* party who can be contacted for acquiring knowledge about or acquisition of the resource

This two profiles can be set in the GeoNode interface by accessing the metadata page and setting the "Point of Contact" and "Metadata Author" fields respectively.

Is possible for an administrator to add new roles if needed, by clicking on the "Add Role" button in the "Base" -> "Contact Roles" section:

Clicking on the "People" section (see figure) will open a web for with some personal information plus a section called "Users".

Is important that this last section is not modified here unless the administrator is very confident in that operation.
