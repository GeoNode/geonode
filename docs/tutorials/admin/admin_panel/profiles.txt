.. _admin_panel.profiles:


Manage profiles using the admin panel
=====================================

Usually the profile section should be updated by the single users using the dedicated link in the GeoNode user dropdown.
Although is possible for an administrator to compile some personal information of the user.

Clicking on the "People" -> "Profiles" section (see figure) will open a web for with some personal information plus a section called "Contact roles".

Is important that this last section is not modified here unless the administrator is very confident in that operation.
