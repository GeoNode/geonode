Manage the metadata categories using the admin panel
====================================================

In the "Base" section are available some links to manage the metadata categories used in GeoNode

.. figure:: img/admin-base.png

The metadata categories are:

* Regions
* Restriction Code Types
* Spatial Representation Types
* Topic Categories

The other links available should not be used.


Regions
-------

The Regions can be modified and added on needs. Currently the regions contain every country with their ISO code.


Restriction Code Types
----------------------

Being GeoNode strictly tied to the standards, the restrictions cannot be added/deleted or modified in their identifier. This behavior is necessary to keep the consistency in case of federation with othe CSW catalogues.

The Restrictions GeoNode description can in any case be modified since it's just the string that will appear on the layer metadata page.

Spatial Representation Types
----------------------------

For this section applies the same concept of the Restriction Code Types

Topic Categories
----------------

Also for the Topic Categories the only part editable is the GeoNode description.
Being standard is assumed that every possible data type will fall under these category identifiers.
