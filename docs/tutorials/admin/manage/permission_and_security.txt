Security and Permissions
========================

This tutorial will guide you through the steps that can be done in order to restrict the access on your data uploaded to geonode.


First of all it will be shown how a user can be created and what permissions he can have. Secondly we will take a closer look
on to layers, maps and documents and the different opportunities you have in order to ban certain users from viewing or editing your
data.

Users
-----

Your first step will be to create a user. There are three options to do so, depending on which kind of user you want to create you may
choose a different option. We will start with creating a *superuser*, because this user is the most important. A superuser
has all the permissions without explicitly assigning them.

The easiest way to create a superuser (in linux) is to open your terminal and type::

  $ geonode createsuperuser

If you installed geonode by source you have to take the following commands::

  $ source .venvs/geonode/bin activate
  $ django-admin.py createsuperuser --settings=geonode.settings
  
You will be asked a username (in this tutorial we will call the superuser you now create *your_superuser*), an email address and a password.
  
Now you've created a superuser you should become familiar with the *Django Admin Interface*. As a superuser you are having
access to this interface, where you can manage users, layers, permission and more. To learn more detailed about this interface
check this LINK. For now it will be enough to just follow the steps. To attend the *Django Admin Interface*, go to your geonode website and *sign in* with *your_superuser*. Once you've logged in, the name of your user will appear on the top right. Click on it and the following menu
will show up:

.. figure:: img/menu_admin.PNG

Clicking on *Admin* causes the interface to show up.

.. figure:: img/admin_interface.PNG
  
Go to *Auth* -> *Users* and you will see all the users that exist at the moment. In your case it will only be *your_superuser*. Click on it, and you will see a section on *Personal Info*, one on *Permissions* and one on *Important dates*. For the moment, the section on *Permissions* is the most important.

.. figure:: img/permissions_django_admin.PNG

As you can see, there are three boxes that can be checked and unchecked. Because you've created a superuser, all three boxes
are checked as default. If only the box *active* would have been checked, the user would not be a superuser and would not be able to
access the *Django Admin Interface* (which is only available for users with the *staff* status). Therefore keep the following
two things in mind:

* a superuser is able to access the *Django Admin Interface* and he has all permissions on the data uploaded to GeoNode.
* an ordinary user (created from the GeoNode interface) only has *active* permissions by default. The user will not have the ability to access the *Django Admin Interface* and certain permissions have to be added for him.

Until now we've only created superusers. So how do you create an ordinary user? You have two options:

#. Django Admin Interface

   First we will create a user via the *Django Admin Interface* because we've still got it open. Therefore go back to *Auth* -> *Users* and      	you should find a button on the right that says *Add user*.    

   .. figure:: img/add_user.PNG
 
   Click on it and a form to fill out will appear. Name the new user test_user, choose a password and click *save* at the right bottom of the  site.

   .. figure:: img/add_test_user.PNG

   Now you should be directed to the site where you could
   change the permissions on the user *test_user*. As default only *active* is checked. If you want this user also to be able to attend this admin interface
   you could also check *staff status*. But for now we leave the settings as they are!

   .. todo:: groups and permissions!
   
   To test whether the new user was successfully created, go back to the GeoNode web page and try to sign in.

#. GeoNode website

   To create an ordinary user you could also just use the GeoNode website. If you installed GeoNode using a release, you should
    see a *Register* button on the top, beside the *Sign in* button (you might have to log out before).
   
   .. figure:: img/register.PNG
   
   Hit the button and again a form will appear for you to fill out. This user will be named *geonode_user*
  
   .. figure:: img/sign_up_test_user.PNG
   .. todo:: NEW IMAGE WITH GEONODE USER!

   By hitting *Sign up* the user will be signed up, as default only with the status *active*. 
   
As mentioned before, this status can be changed as well. To do so, sign in with *your_superuser* again and attend the admin interface. Go again to *Auth* -> *Users*, where now three users
should appear:

   .. img/users_admin_interface.PNG
   .. todo:: CREATE THIS IMAGE!

We now want to change the permission of the *geonode_user* so that he will be able to attend the admin interface as well. 
Click on to *geonode_user* and you will automatically be moved to the site where you can change the permissions. Check the box *staff status* and hit *save* to store the changes.
  
To sum it up, we have now created three users with different kind of permissions.

* **your_superuser**: This user is allowed to attend the admin interface and has all available permissions on layers, maps etc.
* **geonode_user**: This user is permitted to attend the admin interface, but permissions on layers, maps etc. have to be assigned.
* **test_user**: This user is not able to attend the admin interface, permissions on layers, maps etc. have also to be assigned.

.. todo:: is this user permitted to change permission of contact roles, eg.? check this out! or could you assign him these permissions.

   
You should know have an overview over the different kinds of users and how to create and edit them. You've also learned about the permissions a certain user has and how to change them using the *Django Admin Interface*.

.. note:: If you've installed GeoNode in developing mode, the *Register* button won't be seen from the beginning. To add this button to the website, you have to change the `REGISTRATION_OPEN = False` in the settings.py to `REGISTRATION_OPEN = True`. Then reload GeoNode and you should also be able to see the *Register* button.

.. todo:: generally more about the django interface, about the generic roles etc.!

Layers
------

Now that we've already created some users, we will take a closer look on the security of layers, how you can protect your data not to be viewed or edited by unwanted users.

.. hint:: As already mentioned before it is important to know that a superuser does have unrestricted access to all your uploaded data.  That means you cannot ban a superuser from viewing, downloading or editing a layer!

.. todo:: maybe you could do that, using the django admin interface

The permissions on a certain layer can already be set when uploading your files. When the upload form appears (*Layers* -> *Upload Layer*) you will see the permission section on the right side:

.. figure:: img/upload_layer.PNG
  
As it can be seen here, the access on your layer is split up into three groups:

* view and download data
* edit data
* manage and edit data

The difference between *manage and edit layer* and *edit layer* is that a user assigned to *edit layer* is not able to change
the permissions on the layer whereas a user assigned to *manage and edit layer* can change the permissions.
You can now choose whether you want your layer to be viewed and downloaded by

* anyone
* any registered user
* a certain user (or group)

We will now upload our **test layer** like shown HERE. If you want your layer only be viewed by certain users or a group, you have to choose *Only users who can edit* in the part *Who can view and download this data*.
In the section *Who can edit this data* you write down the names of the users you want to have admission on this data. For this first layer we will choose the settings like shown in the following image:

.. img/layer_test_permission.PNG
.. todo:: CREATE THIS IMAGE! settings: view and download = everybody
					edit = geonode_user
					manage = your_superuser (you could leave this empty as well)

.. todo:: BUG about view => only users who can edit => not working; have to set it to any registered users!

If you now log out, your layer can still be seen, but the unregistered users won't be able to edit your layer. Now sign in as *geonode_user* and click on the **test layer**. Above the layer you can see this:

.. figure:: img/edit_and_download_layer.PNG
.. todo:: CHANGE IMAGE TO TEST LAYER!

The *geonode_user* is able to edit the **test_layer**. But before going deeper into this, we have to first take a look on another case. As an administrator you might also upload your layers to geoserver and then make them available on GeoNode using *updatelayers*. Or you even add the layers via the terminal using *importlayers* (LINK TUTORIAL). To set the permissions on this layer, click on the **test layer** (you've uploaded via *updatelayers*) and you will see the same menu as shown in the image above. Click *Edit layer* and the menu will appear.


.. figure:: img/edit_and_manage.PNG

.. todo:: as an owner you are always able to see and edit your layers? CHECK THIS!

.. todo:: maybe tutorial about adding layers for admins?
  
Choose *edit permissions* and a window with the permission settings will appear. This window can also be opened by scrolling down the website. On the right-hand side of the page you should be able to see a button like this.

.. img/change_layer_permissions.PNG
.. todo:: CREATE THIS IMG!! 
  
Click on it and you will see the same window as before.

Now set the permissions of this layer using the following settings:

..  img/permission_test_layer_2.PNG
.. todo:: CREATE THIS IMG!! view and download = only who can edit
	 			edit = test_user
				manage = owner (or empty)

.. todo:: add more details?!

When you assign a user to be able to edit your data, this user is allowed to execute all of the following actions:

* edit metadata
* edit styles
* manage styles
* replace layer
* remove layer

So be aware that each user assigned to edit this layer can even remove it! In our case, only the user *test_user* and *your_superuser* do have the rights to do so. *Geonode_user* is neither able to view nor to download or edit this layer.

.. todo:: There's a bug at the moment!

Now you are logged in as the user *test_user*. Below the **test_layer** you can see the following:

.. img/info.PNG
.. todo:: CREATE/CHANGE THIS IMAGE!!

By clicking *Edit Layer* and *Edit Metadata* on top of the layer, you can change this information. The *test_user* is able to change all the metadata of this layer. We now want to change to *point of contact*, therefore scroll down until you see this:

.. figure:: img/point_of_contact.PNG


Change the *point of contact* from *_who_ever_created_this* to *test_user*. *Save* your changes and you will now be able to see the following:

.. img/point_of_contact_changed.PNG
.. todo:: CHANGE THIS IMAGE!
.. todo:: more detailed!
.. todo:: did i miss anything?

.. warning:: If you allow a user to view and download a layer, this user will also be able to edit the styles, even if he is not assigned to edit the layer! Keep this in mind!

.. todo:: there is an issue about that! don't know whether it is going to be changed!

To learn how you can edit metadata or change the styles go to this section LINK.

.. todo:: DJANGO ADMIN INTERFACE!

Maps
----

The permission on maps are basically the same as on layers, just that there are fewer options on how to edit the map. Let's create a map (or already TUTORIAL?). Click on **test_map** and scroll down till you see this:

.. figure:: img/change_map_permissions.PNG

Here you can set the same permissions as known from the layer permissions! Set the permissions of this map as seen here:

.. img/test_map_permissions.PNG
.. todo:: CREATE THIS IMAGE:: view = anybody
				edit = *geonode_user* and *test_user*
				manage = *geonode_user*

Save your changes and then log out and log in as *test_user*. You should now be able to view the *test_map* and click on to *Edit map*.

.. figure:: img/edit_map.PNG

.. todo:: this IMAGE should be without add permissions!! but not possible at the moment!

As you may recognize, this user is not able to change the permissions on this map. If you log in as the user *geonode_user* you should be able to see the button *change map permissions* when you scroll down the page.

Documents
---------

All the same is also valid for your uploaded documents.
