Introduction
============

GeoServer, i.e. the geospatial backend server of GeoNode, is a sptial server which needs authenticated users in order to access protected resources or administration functions.

GeoServer supports several kind of Authentication and Authorization mechanisms. Those systems are pluggable and GeoServer can use them at the same time by the use of a ``Filter Chain``.
Briefly this mechanism allows GeoServer to check for different A&A protocols one by one. The first one matching is used by GeoServer to authorize the users.

GeoNode Authentication is based by default on Django Security Subsystem. Django authentication allows GeoNode to manage its internal users, groups, roles and sessions.

GeoNode has some external components, like GeoServer or QGis Server, which are pluggable and stand-alone services, devoted to the management of geospatial data.
Those external services have theyr own authentication and authorization mechanisms which must be syncronized somehow with the GeoNode one. Also, those external services
maintain, in most of the cases and unless specific configuration does not disable this, alternative security access which for instance allow GeoNode to modify the geospatial catalog
under the hood, or a system administrator to have indipendent and priviliged access to the servers.

Before going deeply on how GeoServer/GeoNode A&A works and how it can be configured in order to work correctly with GeoNode, lets quickly clarify the difference between the ``Authentication`` and ``Authorization`` concepts.

Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of someone through the use of some sort of credentials and an handshake protocol.
If the credentials are valid, the authorization process starts. Authentication process always proceeds to Authorization process (although they may often seem to be combined).
The two terms are often used synonymously but they are two different processes.

For more details and explanation about the authentication concepts, take a look `here <http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/authentication>`_.

Authorization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Authorization is the process of allowing authenticated users to access protected resources by checking its roles and rights against some sort of security rules mechanism or protocol.
In other words it allows to control access rights by granting or denying specific permissions to specific authorized users.

GeoNode Security Backend
========================

DJango Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Django authentication system handles both authentication and authorization.

The auth system consists of:

#. Users
#. Permissions: Binary (yes/no) flags designating whether a user may perform a certain task.
#. Groups: A generic way of applying labels and permissions to more than one user.
#. A configurable password hashing system
#. Forms and view tools for logging in users, or restricting content
#. A pluggable backend system

The authentication system in Django aims to be very generic and doesn’t provide some features commonly found in web authentication systems. Solutions for some of these common problems have been implemented in third-party packages:

#. Password strength checking
#. Throttling of login attempts
#. Authentication against third-parties (OAuth, for example)

.. note:: For more details on installation and configuration of Django authentication system, please refer to the official guide https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/auth/.

GeoNode communicates with GeoServer through Basic Authentication under the hood, in order to configure the data and the GeoServer catalog.

In order to do this, you must be sure that GeoNode knows the **internal** admin user and password of GeoServer.

.. warning:: This must be an internal GeoServer user with admin rights, not a GeoNode one.

Make sure the credentials are correctly configured into the file ``settings.py``

OGC_SERVER
----------

Ensure that the ``OGC_SERVER`` settings are correctly configured.

Notice that the two properties ``LOGIN_ENDPOINT`` and ``LOGOUT_ENDPOINT`` must speficy the GeoServer OAuth2 Endpoints (see details below).
The default values ``'j_spring_oauth2_geonode_login'`` and ``'j_spring_oauth2_geonode_logout'`` work in most of the cases, unless you need some specific endpoints different from the latters.
In any case those values **must** be coherent with the GeoServer OAuth2 Plugin configuration.

If in doubt, please use the default values here below.

Default values are:

.. code-block:: python

    ...
    # OGC (WMS/WFS/WCS) Server Settings
    # OGC (WMS/WFS/WCS) Server Settings
    OGC_SERVER = {
        'default': {
            'BACKEND': 'geonode.geoserver',
            'LOCATION': GEOSERVER_LOCATION,
            'LOGIN_ENDPOINT': 'j_spring_oauth2_geonode_login',
            'LOGOUT_ENDPOINT': 'j_spring_oauth2_geonode_logout',
            # PUBLIC_LOCATION needs to be kept like this because in dev mode
            # the proxy won't work and the integration tests will fail
            # the entire block has to be overridden in the local_settings
            'PUBLIC_LOCATION': GEOSERVER_PUBLIC_LOCATION,
            'USER': 'admin',
            'PASSWORD': 'geoserver',
            'MAPFISH_PRINT_ENABLED': True,
            'PRINT_NG_ENABLED': True,
            'GEONODE_SECURITY_ENABLED': True,
            'GEOGIG_ENABLED': False,
            'WMST_ENABLED': False,
            'BACKEND_WRITE_ENABLED': True,
            'WPS_ENABLED': False,
            'LOG_FILE': '%s/geoserver/data/logs/geoserver.log' % os.path.abspath(os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, os.pardir)),
            # Set to name of database in DATABASES dictionary to enable
            'DATASTORE': '',  # 'datastore',
            'PG_GEOGIG': False,
            'TIMEOUT': 10  # number of seconds to allow for HTTP requests
        }
    }
    ...

GeoNode and GeoServer A&A Interaction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The GeoServer instance used by GeoNode, has a perticular setup that allows the two frameworks to correctly interact and exchange informations on users credentials and permissions.

In particular GeoServer is configured with a ``Filter Chain`` for Authorization that makes use of the two following protocols:

    #. **Basic Authentication**; this is the default GeoServer Authentication mechanism. This makes use of `rfc2617 - Basic and Digest Access Authentication <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617>`_ in order to check for user's credentials.
        In other words, GeoServer takes a ``username`` and a ``password`` encoded `Base64 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648>`_ on the HTTP Request Headers and compare them against its internal database (which by default is an encrypted XML file on the GeoServer Data Dir).
        If the user's credentials match, then GeoServer checks for Authorization through its ``Role Services`` (we will see those services in details on the *GeoServer (Security Backend)* section below).

        .. note:: GeoServer ships by default with ``admin`` and ``geoserver`` as the default administrator user name and password. Before putting the GeoServer on-line it is imperative to change at least the administrator password.

    #. **OAuth2 Authentication**; this module allows GeoServer to authenticate against the `OAuth2 Protocol <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749>`_. If the Basic Authentication fails, GeoServer falls back to this by using GeoNode as OAuth2 Provider by default.

.. note:: Further details can be found directly on the official GeoServer documentation at section "`Authentication Chain <http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/security/auth/chain.html#security-auth-chain>`_"

From the **GeoNode backend (server) side**, the server will make use of **Basic Authentication** with administrator credentials to configure the GeoServer catalog. GeoServer must be reachable by GeoNode of course, and GeoNode must know the internal GeoServer admin credentials.

From the **GeoNode frontend (browser and GUI) side**, the *Authentication* goal is to allow GeoServer to recognize as valid a user which has been already logged into GeoNode, providing kind of an `SSO <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on>`_ mechanism between the two applications.

GeoServer must know and must be able to access GeoNode via HTTP/HTTPS. In other words, an external user connected to GeoNode must be authenticated to GeoServer with same permissions. This is possible through the **OAuth2 Authentication** Protocol.

**GeoNode / GeoServer Authentication Mechanism**

    *GeoNode as OAuth2 Provider (OP)*

    OpenID Connect is an identity framework built on OAuth 2.0 protocol which extends the authorization of OAuth 2.0 processes to implement its authentication mechanism. OpenID Connect adds a discovery mechanism allowing users to use an external trusted authority as an identity provider. From another point of view, this can be seen as a single sign on (SSO) system.

    OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework which is capable of providing a way for clients to access a resource with restricted access on behalf of the resource owner. OpenID Connect allows clients to verify the users with an authorization server based authentication.

    As an OP, GeoNode will be able to act as trusted identity provider, thus allowing the system working on an isolated environment and/or allow GeoNode to authenticate private users managed by the local DJango auth subsystem.

    *GeoServer as OAuth2 Relying Party (RP)*

    Thanks to the **OAuth2 Authentication** GeoServer is able to retrieve an end user's identity directly from the OAuth2 Provider (OP).

    With GeoNode acting as an OP, the mechanism will avoid the use of cookies relying, instead, on the OAuth2 secure protocol.

    How the OAuth2 Protocol works:

        .. figure:: img/oauth001.png

    1. The relying party sends the request to the OAuth2 provider to authenticate the end user

    2. The OAuth2 provider authenticates the user

    3. The OAuth2 provider sends the ID token and access token to the relying party

    4. The relying party sends a request to the user info endpoint with the access token received from OAuth2 provider

    5. The user info endpoint returns the claims.

**GeoNode / GeoServer Authorization Mechanism**

    Allowing GeoServer to make use of a OAuth2 in order to act as an OAuth2 RP, is not sufficient to map a user identity to its roles though.

    On GeoServer side we will still need to a ``RoleService`` which would be able to talk to GeoNode and transform the tokens into a User Principal to be used within the GeoServer Security subsystem itself.

    In other words after a successfull Authentication, GeoServer needs to Authorize the user in order to understand which resources he is enable to access or not.
    A ``REST based RoleService`` on GeoNode side, allows GeoServer to talk to GeoNode via `REST <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer>`_ to get the current user along with the list of its Roles.

    Nevertheless knowning the Roles associated to a user is not sufficient. The complete GeoServer Authorization needs to catch a set of ``Access Rules``, associdated to the Roles, in order to establish which resources and data are accessible by the user.

    The GeoServer Authorization is based on Roles only, therefore for each authenticated user we need also to know:

        1. The Roles associated to a valid user session

        2. The access permissions associated to a GeoServer Resource

    The Authentication mechanism above allows GeoServer to get information about the user and his Roles, which addresses point 1.

    About point 2, GeoServer makes use of the `GeoFence Embedded Server <http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/community/geofence-server/index.html>`_ plugin.
    GeoFence is a java web application that provides an advanced authentication / authorization engine for GeoServer using the interface described in `here <https://github.com/geoserver/geofence/wiki/First-steps>`_.
    GeoFence has its own rules database for the management of Authorization rules, and overrides the standard GeoServer security management system by implementing a sophisticated Resource Access Manager.
    Least but not last, GeoFence implements and exposes a `REST API <https://github.com/geoserver/geofence/wiki/REST-API>`_ allowing remote authorized clients to read / write / modify security rules.

    The advantages using such plugin are multiple:

        1. The Authorizations rules have a fine granularity. The security rules are handled by GeoFence in a way similar to the iptables ones, and allow to define security constraints even on sub-regions and attributes of layers.

        2. GeoFence exposes a REST interface to its internal rule database, allowing external managers to update the security constraints programmatically

        3. GeoFence implements an internal caching mechanism which improves considerably the performances under load.

    *GeoNode interaction with GeoFence*

    GeoNode itself is able to push/manage Authorization rules to GeoServer through the GeoFence `REST API <https://github.com/geoserver/geofence/wiki/REST-API>`_, acting as an administrator for GeoServer.
    GeoNode properly configures the GeoFence rules anytime it is needed, i.e. the permissions of a Resource / Layer are updated.

GeoServer must know and must be able to access GeoNode via HTTP/HTTPS. In other words, an external user connected to GeoNode must be authenticated to GeoServer with same permissions. This is possible through the **GeoNodeCoockieProcessingFiler**.

Summarizing we will have different ways to access GeoNode Layers:

#. Through GeoNode via DJango Authentication and **GeoNodeCoockieProcessingFiler**; basically the users available in GeoNode are also valid for GeoServer or any other backend.

    .. warning:: If a GeoNode user has "administrator" rights, he will be able to administer GeoServer too.

#. Through GeoServer Security Subsystem; it will be always possible to access to GeoServer using its internal security system and users, unless explictly disabled (**warning** this is dangeruos, you must know what you are doing).

Lets now see in details how the single pieces are configured and how they can be configured.

DJango OAuth Toolkit Setup and Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As stated above, GeoNode makes use of the OAuth2 protocol for all the frontend interactions with GeoServer. GeoNode must be conifgured as an OAuth2 Provider and provide a ``Client ID`` and a ``Client Sercret`` kayes to GeoServer.
This is possible by enabling and configuring the `Django OAuth Toolkit Plugin <https://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

.. warning:: GeoNode and GeoServer won't work at all if the follwing steps are not executed at the first installation.

Default ``settings.py`` Security Settings for OAuth2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Double check that the OAuth2 Provider and Security Plugin is enabled and that the settings below are correctly configured.

AUTH_IP_WHITELIST
-----------------

``AUTH_IP_WHITELIST`` property limits access to users/groups REST Role Service endpoints to the only whitelisted IP addresses. Empty list means 'allow all'.
If you need to limit 'api' REST calls to only some specific IPs fill the list like this: ``AUTH_IP_WHITELIST = ['192.168.1.158', '192.168.1.159']``

Default values are:

.. code-block:: python

    ...
    AUTH_IP_WHITELIST = []
    ...

INSTALLED_APPS
--------------

In order to allow GeoNode to act as an OAuth2 Provider, we need to enable the ``oauth2_provider`` DJango application provided by the "Django OAuth Toolkit".

Default values are:

.. code-block:: python

    ...
    INSTALLED_APPS = (

        'modeltranslation',

        ...
        'guardian',
        'oauth2_provider',
        ...

    ) + GEONODE_APPS
    ...

MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES
------------------

Installing the `oauth2_provider`` DJango application is not sufficient to enable the full functionality. We need also GeoNode to include additional entities to its internal model.

Default values are:

.. code-block:: python

    ...
    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
        'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
        'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
        'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware',

        # The setting below makes it possible to serve different languages per
        # user depending on things like headers in HTTP requests.
        'django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware',
        'pagination.middleware.PaginationMiddleware',
        'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',
        'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
        'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware',

        # This middleware allows to print private layers for the users that have
        # the permissions to view them.
        # It sets temporary the involved layers as public before restoring the permissions.
        # Beware that for few seconds the involved layers are public there could be risks.
        # 'geonode.middleware.PrintProxyMiddleware',

        # If you use SessionAuthenticationMiddleware, be sure it appears before OAuth2TokenMiddleware.
        # SessionAuthenticationMiddleware is NOT required for using django-oauth-toolkit.
        'django.contrib.auth.middleware.SessionAuthenticationMiddleware',
        'oauth2_provider.middleware.OAuth2TokenMiddleware',
    )
    ...

AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS
-----------------------

In order to allow GeoNode to act as an OAuth2 Provider, we need to enable the ``oauth2_provider.backends.OAuth2Backend`` DJango backend provided by the "Django OAuth Toolkit".
Also notice that we need to specify the OAuth2 Provider scopes and declare which ``generator`` to use in order to create ``OAuth2 Client IDs``.

Default values are:

.. code-block:: python

    ...
    # Replacement of default authentication backend in order to support
    # permissions per object.
    AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
        'oauth2_provider.backends.OAuth2Backend',
        'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
        'guardian.backends.ObjectPermissionBackend',
    )

    OAUTH2_PROVIDER = {
        'SCOPES': {
            'read': 'Read scope',
            'write': 'Write scope',
            'groups': 'Access to your groups'
        },

        'CLIENT_ID_GENERATOR_CLASS': 'oauth2_provider.generators.ClientIdGenerator',
    }
    ...

Django OAuth Toolkit Admin Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the ``settings.py`` and ``local_settings.py`` have been correctly configured for your system:

#. Complete the GeoNode setup steps

    * Prepare the model

        .. code-block:: python

            python manage.py makemigrations
            python manage.py migrate
            python manage.py syncdb

    * Prepare the static data

        .. code-block:: python

            python manage.py collectstatic

    * Make sure the database has been populated with initial default data

        .. warning:: *Deprecated* this command will be replaced by migrations in the future, so be careful.

        .. code-block:: python

            python manage.py loaddata initial_data.json

    * Make sure there exists a superuser for your environment

        .. warning:: *Deprecated* this command will be replaced by migrations in the future, so be careful.

        .. code-block:: python

            python manage.py createsuperuser

    .. note:: Read the base tutorials on GeoNode Developer documentation for details on the specific commands and how to use them.

#. Start the application

    Start GeoNode accordingly on how the setup has been done; run debug mode through ``paver``, or proxied by an HTTP Server like Apache2 HTTPD, Nginx or others.

#. Finalize the setup of the OAuth2 Provider

    First of all you need to configure and create a new OAuth2 Application called ``GeoServer`` through the GeoNode Admin Dashboard

    * Access the GeoNode Admin Dashboard

        .. figure:: img/oauth002.png

    * Go to ``Django OAuth Toolkit`` > ``Applications``

        .. figure:: img/oauth003.png

    * Update or create the Application named ``GeoServer``

        .. warning:: The Application name **must** be ``GeoServer``

        .. figure:: img/oauth004.png

        - ``Client id``; An alphanumeric code representing the OAuth2 Client Id. GeoServer OAuth2 Plugin **will** use **this** value.

            .. warning:: In a production environment it is **highly** recommended to modify the default value provided with GeoNode installation.

        - ``User``; Search for the ``admin`` user. Its ``ID`` will be automatically updated into the form.

        - ``Redirect uris``; It is possible to specify many URIs here. Those must coincide with the GeoServer instances URIs.

        - ``Client type``; Choose ``Confidential``

        - ``Authorization grant type``; Choose ``Authorization code``

        - ``Client secret``; An alphanumeric code representing the OAuth2 Client Secret. GeoServer OAuth2 Plugin **will** use **this** value.

            .. warning:: In a production environment it is **highly** recommended to modify the default value provided with GeoNode installation.

        - ``Name``; **Must** be ``GeoServer``

GeoServer Security Backend
==========================

GeoServer Security Subsystem
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GeoServer has a robust security subsystem, modeled on Spring Security. Most of the security features are available through the Web administration interface.

For more details on how this works and how to configure and modify it, please refer to the official GeoServer guide http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/security/webadmin/index.html

By using the ``GeoServer Data Dir`` provided with GeoNode build, the following configuration are already available. You will need just to update them accordingly to your environment (like IP addresses and Host names, OAuth2 Keys, and similar things).
However it is recommended to read carefully all the following passages in order to understand exactly how the different component are configured and easily identify any possible issue during the deployment.

The main topics of this section are:

#. Connection to the GeoNode REST Role Service

#. Setup of the GeoServer OAuth2 Authentication Filter

#. Configuration of the GeoServer Filter Chains

#. Setup and test of the GeoFence Server and Default Rules

Connection to the GeoNode REST Role Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Preliminary checks
------------------

* GeoServer is up and running and you have admin rights

* GeoServer must reach the GeoNode instance via HTTP

* The GeoServer Host IP Address must be allowed to access the GeoNode Role Service APIs (see the section ``AUTH_IP_WHITELIST`` above)

Setup of the GeoNode REST Role Service
--------------------------------------

#. Login as ``admin`` to the GeoServer GUI

    .. warning:: In a production system remember to change the default admin credentials ``admin`` \ ``geoserver``

    .. figure:: img/oauth005.png

#. Access the ``Security`` > ``Users, Groups, Roles`` section

    .. figure:: img/oauth006.png

#. **If not yet configured** the service ``geonode REST role service``, click on ``Role Services`` > ``Add new``

    .. note:: This passage is **not** needed if the ``geonode REST role service`` has been already created. If so it will be displayed amond the Role Services list

        .. figure:: img/oauth008.png

    .. figure:: img/oauth007.png

#. **If not yet configured** the service ``geonode REST role service``, choose ``AuthKEY REST - Role service from REST endpoint``

    .. figure:: img/oauth009.png

#. Create / update the ``geonode REST role service`` accordingly

    .. figure:: img/oauth010.png

    - ``Name``; **Must** be ``geonode REST role service``

    - ``Base Server URL``; Must point to the GeoNode instance base URL (e.g. ``http://<geonode_host_url>``)

    - ``Roles REST Endpoint``; Enter ``/api/roles``

    - ``Admin Role REST Endpoint``; Enter ``/api/adminRole``

    - ``Users REST Endpoint``; Enter ``/api/users``

    - ``Roles JSON Path``; Enter ``$.groups``

    - ``Admin Role JSON Path``; Enter ``$.adminRole``

    - ``Users JSON Path``; Enter ``$.users[0].groups``

    Once everything has been setup and it is working, choose the ``Administrator role`` and ``Group administrator role`` as ``ROLE_ADMIN``

#. Access the ``Security`` > ``Settings`` section

    .. figure:: img/oauth011.png

#. Choose the ``geonode REST role service`` as ``Active role service``

    .. figure:: img/oauth012.png

Setup of the GeoServer OAuth2 Authentication Filter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is necessary now check that GeoServer can connect to OAuth2 Providers (specifically to GeoNode OP), and being able to Authenticate users through it.

Preliminary checks
------------------

* GeoServer is up and running and you have admin rights

* GeoServer must reach the GeoNode instance via HTTP

* OAuth2 ``Client ID`` and ``Client Secret`` have been generated on GeoNode and known

Setup of the GeoNode OAuth2 Security Filter
-------------------------------------------

#. Access the ``Security`` > ``Authentication`` section

    .. figure:: img/oauth013.png

#. **If not yet configured** the Authentication Filter ``geonode-oauth2 - Authentication using a GeoNode OAuth2``, click on ``Authentication Filters`` > ``Add new``

    .. note:: This passage is **not** needed if the ``geonode-oauth2 - Authentication using a GeoNode OAuth2`` has been already created. If so it will be displayed amond the Authentication Filters list

        .. figure:: img/oauth015.png

    .. figure:: img/oauth014.png

#. **If not yet configured** the Authentication Filter ``geonode-oauth2 - Authentication using a GeoNode OAuth2``, choose ``GeoNode OAuth2 - Authenticates by looking up for a valid GeoNode OAuth2 access_token key sent as URL parameter``

    .. figure:: img/oauth016.png

#. Create / update the ``geonode-oauth2 - Authentication using a GeoNode OAuth2`` accordingly

    .. figure:: img/oauth017.png

    - ``Name``; **Must** be ``geonode-oauth2``

    - ``Enable Redirect Authentication EntryPoint``; It is recommended to put this to ``False``, otherwise GeoServer won't allow you to connect to its Admin GUI through the ``Form`` but only through GeoNode

    - ``Login Authentication EndPoint``; Unless you have specific needs, keep the default value ``/j_spring_oauth2_geonode_login``

    - ``Logout Authentication EndPoint``; Unless you have specific needs, keep the default value ``/j_spring_oauth2_geonode_logout``

    - ``Force Access Token URI HTTPS Secured Protocol``; This must be ``False`` unless you enabled a ``Secured Connection`` on GeoNode. In that case you will need to trust the GeoNode ``Certificate`` on the GeoServer JVM Kaystore. Please see details below

    - ``Access Token URI``; Set this to ``http://<geonode_host_base_url>/o/token/``

    - ``Force User Authorization URI HTTPS Secured Protocol``; This must be ``False`` unless you enabled a ``Secured Connection`` on GeoNode. In that case you will need to trust the GeoNode ``Certificate`` on the GeoServer JVM Kaystore. Please see details below

    - ``User Authorization URI``; Set this to ``http://<geonode_host_base_url>/o/authorize/``

    - ``Redirect URI``; Set this to ``http://<geoserver_host>/geoserver``. This address **must** be presenet on the ``Reditect uris`` of GeoNode ``OAuth2`` > ``Applications`` > ``GeoServer`` (see above)

    - ``Check Token Endpoint URL``; Set this to ``http://<geonode_host_base_url>/api/o/v4/tokeninfo/``

    - ``Logout URI``; Set this to ``http://<geonode_host_base_url>/account/logout/``

    - ``Scopes``; Unless you have specific needs, keep the default value ``read,write,groups``

    - ``Client ID``; The ``Client id`` alphanumeric key generated by the GeoNode ``OAuth2`` > ``Applications`` > ``GeoServer`` (see above)

    - ``Client Secret``; The ``Client secret`` alphanumeric key generated by the GeoNode ``OAuth2`` > ``Applications`` > ``GeoServer`` (see above)

    - ``Role source``; In order to authorize the user against GeoNode, choose ``Role service`` > ``geonode REST role service``

Configuration of the GeoServer Filter Chains
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following steps ensure GeoServer can adopt more Authentication methods. As stated above, it is possible to Authenticate to GeoServer using different protocols.

GeoServer scans the authentication filters chain associated to the specified path and tries them one by one sequentially.
The first one matching the protocol and able to grant access to the user, breaks the cycle by creating a ``User Principal`` and injecting it into the GeoServer ``SecurityContext``.
The Authentication process, then, ends here and the control goes to the Authorization one, which will try to retrieve the authenticated user's Roles through the available GeoServer Role Services associated to the Authentication Filter that granted the access.

Preliminary checks
------------------

* GeoServer is up and running and you have admin rights

* GeoServer must reach the GeoNode instance via HTTP

* The ``geonode-oauth2 - Authentication using a GeoNode OAuth2`` Authentication Filter and the  ``geonode REST role service`` have been correctly configured

Setup of the GeoServer Filter Chains

        </logoutFilter>

    .. warning:: The value ``j_spring_oauth2_geonode_logout`` **must** be the same specified as ``Logout Authentication EndPoint`` in the ``geonode-oauth2 - Authentication using a GeoNode OAuth2`` above.

Setup and test of the GeoFence Server and Default Rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to work correctly, GeoServer needs the `GeoFence Embedded Server <http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/community/geofence-server/index.html>`_ plugin to be installed and configured on the system.

The GeoServer configuration provided for GeoNode, has the plugin already installed with a default configuration. In that case double check that the plugin works correctly and the default rules have been setup by following the next steps.

Preliminary checks
------------------

* GeoServer is up and running and you have admin rights

* The `GeoFence Embedded Server <http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/community/geofence-server/index.html>`_ plugin has been installed on GeoServer

Setup of the GeoServer Filter Chains
------------------------------------

#. Access the ``Security`` > ``Authentication`` section

    .. figure:: img/oauth013.png

#. Identify the section ``Authentication Providers`` and make sure the ``geofence`` Authentication Provider is present

    .. figure:: img/oauth032.png

#. Make sure the ``Provider Chain`` is configured as shown below

    .. figure:: img/oauth033.png

    .. warning:: Every time you modify a Authentication Providers, **don't forget to save** the ``Authentication`` settings. This **must** be done for **each** change.

        .. figure:: img/oauth020.png

Setup of the GeoFence Server and Rules
--------------------------------------

#. Make sure GeoFence server works and the default settings are correctly configured

    - Access the ``Security`` > ``GeoFence`` section

        .. figure:: img/oauth026.png

    - Make sure the ``Options`` are configured as follows and the server works well when performing a ``Test Connection``

        .. figure:: img/oauth027.png

        * ``Allow remote and inline layers in SLD``; Set it to ``True``

        * ``Allow SLD and SLD_BODY parameters in requests``; Set it to ``True``

        * ``Authenticated users can write``; Set it to ``True``

        * ``Use GeoServer roles to get authorizations``; Set it to ``False``

#. Check the GeoFence default Rules

    - Access the ``Security`` > ``GeoFence Data Rules`` section

        .. figure:: img/oauth028.png

    - Make sure the ``DENY ALL`` Rule is present by default, otherwise your data will be accessible to everyone

        .. note:: This rule is **always** the last one

        .. figure:: img/oauth029.png

        .. warning:: If that rule does not exists **at the very bottom** (this rule is **always** the last one), add it manually.

    - Access the ``Security`` > ``GeoFence Admin Rules`` section

        .. figure:: img/oauth030.png

    - No Rules needed here

        .. figure:: img/oauth031.png

Throubleshooting and Advanced Features
======================================

Common Issues and Fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* GeoServer/GeoNode OAuth2 does not authenticate as Administrator even using GeoNode ``admin`` users

    **Symptoms**

        When trying to authenticate with an ``admin`` user using OAuth2, the process correctly redirects to GeoServer page but I'm not a GeoServer Administrator.

    **Cause**

        That means that somehow GeoServer could not successfully complete the Authorization and Authentication process.

        The possible causes of the problem may be the following ones:

        1. The OAuth2 Authentication fails on GeoServer side

            This is usually due to an exception while trying to complete the Authentication process.

            - A typical cause is that GeoServer tries to use HTTPS connections but the GeoNode certificate is not trusted;

                In that case please refer to the section below. Also take a look at the logs (in particular the GeoServer one) as explained in :ref:`debug_geonode`.
                The GeoServer logs should contain a detailed Exception explaining the cause of the problem.
                If no exception is listed here (even after raised the log level to *DEBUG*), try to check for the GeoNode Role Service as explained below.

            - Another possible issue is that somehow the OAuth2 handshake cannot complete successfully;

                1. Login into GeoServer as administrator through its WEB login form.

                2. Double check that all the ``geonode-oauth2 - Authentication using a GeoNode OAuth2`` parameters are correct. If everything is ok, take a look at the logs (in particular the GeoServer one) as explained in :ref:`debug_geonode`.
                   The GeoServer logs should contain a detailed Exception explaining the cause of the problem. If no exception is listed here (even after raised the log level to *DEBUG*), try to check for the GeoNode Role Service as explained below.

        2. GeoServer is not able to retrieve the user Role from a Role Service

            Always double check both HTTP Server and GeoServer log as specified in section :ref:`debug_geonode`. This might directly guide you to the cause of the problem.

            - Check that the GeoServer host is granted to access GeoNode Role Service REST APIs in the ``AUTH_IP_WHITELIST`` of the ``settings.py``

            - Check that the ``geonode REST role service`` is the default Role service and that the GeoServer OAuth2 Plugin has been configured to use it by default

            - Check that the GeoNode REST Role Service APIs are functional and produce correct JSON.

                This is possible by using simple ``cUrl`` GET calls like

                .. code-block:: shell

                    curl http://localhost/api/adminRole
                    $> {"adminRole": "admin"}


                    curl http://localhost/api/users
                    $> {"users": [{"username": "AnonymousUser", "groups": ["anonymous"]}, {"username": "afabiani", "groups": ["anonymous", "test"]}, {"username": "admin", "groups": ["anonymous", "test", "admin"]}]}

                    curl http://localhost/api/roles
                    $> {"groups": ["anonymous", "test", "admin"]}

                    curl http://localhost/api/users/admin
                    $> {"users": [{"username": "admin", "groups": ["anonymous", "test", "admin"]}]}


How to setup ``HTTPS`` secured endpoints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In a production system it is a good practice to encrypt the connection between GeoServer and GeoNode. That would be possible by enabling HTTPS Protocol on the GeoNode REST Role Service APIs and OAuth2 Endpoints.

Most of the times you will rely on a self-signed HTTPS connection using a generated certificate. That makes the connection *untrasted* and you will need to tell to the GeoServer Java Virtual Machine to trust it.

This can be done by following the steps below.

For any issue take a look at the logs (in particular the GeoServer one) as explained in :ref:`debug_geonode`. The GeoServer logs should contain a detailed Exception explaining the cause of the problem.

SSL Trusted Certificates
------------------------

When using a custom ``Keystore`` or trying to access a non-trusted or self-signed SSL-protected OAuth2 Provider from a non-SSH connection, you will need to add the certificates to the JVM ``Keystore``.

In order to do this you can follow the next steps:

    In this example we are going to

	#. Retrieve SSL Certificate from GeoNode domain:

		"Access Token URI" = https://<geonode_host_base_url>/o/token/ therefore we need to trust ``https://<geonode_host_base_url>`` or (``<geonode_host_base_url>:443``)

		.. note:: You will need to get and trust certificates from every different HTTPS URL used on OAuth2 Endpoints.

	#. Store SSL Certificates on local hard-disk

	#. Add SSL Certificates to the Java Keystore

	#. Enable the JVM to check for SSL Certificates from the Keystore

1. Retrieve the SSL Certificate from GeoNode domain

	Use the ``openssl`` command in order to dump the certificate

	For ``https://<geonode_host_base_url>``

		.. code-block:: shell

			openssl s_client -connect <geonode_host_base_url>:443

		.. figure:: img/google_ssl_001.png
		   :align: center

2. Store SSL Certificate on local hard-disk

	Copy-and-paste the section ``-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-``, ``-END CERTIFICATE-`` and save it into a ``.cert`` file

	.. note:: ``.cert`` file are plain text files containing the ASCII characters included on the ``-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-``, ``-END CERTIFICATE-`` sections

	``geonode.cert`` (or whatever name you want with ``.cert`` extension)

        .. figure:: img/google_ssl_003.png
           :align: center

3. Add SSL Certificates to the Java Keystore

	You can use the Java command ``keytool`` like this

	``geonode.cert`` (or whatever name you want with ``.cert`` extension)

		.. code-block:: shell

			keytool -import -noprompt -trustcacerts -alias geonode -file geonode.cert -keystore ${KEYSTOREFILE} -storepass ${KEYSTOREPASS}

    or, alternatively, you can use some graphic tool which helps you managing the SSL Certificates and Keystores, like `Portecle <http://portecle.sourceforge.net/>`_

		.. code-block:: shell

			java -jar c:\apps\portecle-1.9\portecle.jar

        .. figure:: img/google_ssl_005.png
           :align: center

        .. figure:: img/google_ssl_006.png
           :align: center

        .. figure:: img/google_ssl_007.png
           :align: center

        .. figure:: img/google_ssl_008.png
           :align: center

        .. figure:: img/google_ssl_009.png
           :align: center

        .. figure:: img/google_ssl_010.png
           :align: center

        .. figure:: img/google_ssl_011.png
           :align: center

        .. figure:: img/google_ssl_012.png
           :align: center

        .. figure:: img/google_ssl_013.png
           :align: center

4. Enable the JVM to check for SSL Certificates from the Keystore

	In order to do this, you need to pass a ``JAVA_OPTION`` to your JVM:

		.. code-block:: shell

			-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=F:\tmp\keystore.key

5. Restart your server

.. note:: Here below you can find a bash script which simplifies the Keystore SSL Certificates importing. Use it at your conveninece.

	.. code-block:: shell

		HOST=myhost.example.com
		PORT=443
		KEYSTOREFILE=dest_keystore
		KEYSTOREPASS=changeme

		# get the SSL certificate
		openssl s_client -connect ${HOST}:${PORT} </dev/null \
			| sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > ${HOST}.cert

		# create a keystore and import certificate
		keytool -import -noprompt -trustcacerts \
			-alias ${HOST} -file ${HOST}.cert \
			-keystore ${KEYSTOREFILE} -storepass ${KEYSTOREPASS}

		# verify we've got it.
		keytool -list -v -keystore ${KEYSTOREFILE} -storepass ${KEYSTOREPASS} -alias ${HOST}

GeoFence Rules Management and Tutorials
---------------------------------------

* `This tutorial <http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/community/geofence-server/tutorial.html>`_ shows how to install and configure the Geofence Internal Server plug-in. It shows how to create rules in two ways: using the GUI and REST methods.

* GeoFence Rules can be created / updated / deleted through a REST API, accessible only by a GeoServer Admin user. You can find more details on how the GeoFence REST API works `here <https://github.com/geoserver/geofence/wiki/REST-API>`_.

GeoFence Rules Storage Configuration
------------------------------------

By default GeoFence is configured to use a filesystem based DB stored on the GeoServer Data Dir ``<GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR/geofence``.

* It is possible also to configure GeoFence in order to use an external PostgreSQL / PostGIS Database. In order to do that please refer to the official GeoFence documentation `here <https://github.com/geoserver/geofence/wiki/GeoFence-configuration>`_.
