Installation using the ubunut config file
=========================================


Get the code::

    $ git clone https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode.git
    $ cd geonode

The package comes with a semi-automatic installer, located in the unzipped directory.
The installer script (located in package/support/config-ubuntu.sh) has a configuration file associated with it which allows you to provide the details of your installation, such as where your webserver looks for documents.

Once edited (if necessary) the config file running the following command will install GeoNode::

    sudo ./install.sh support/config-ubuntu.sh
