Custom Installation Guide
=========================

Use this if you want to know how to manually deploy GeoNode or if you want to
deploy it on a server
which is not fresh. Otherwise please use the :ref:`quick_installation` .
The manual installation is intended for those who are comfortable with Linux
system administration.


.. note:: Here is the link to our :ref:`quick_installation` .

Recommended Minimum System Requirements
---------------------------------------

For deployment of GeoNode on a single server,
the following are the *bare minimum* system requirements:

* 6GB of RAM, including swap space.
* 2.2GHz processor.  (Additional processing power may be required for multiple
  concurrent styling renderings)
* 1 GB software disk usage.
* Additional disk space for any data hosted with GeoNode and tiles cached with
  GeoWebCache.
  For spatial data, cached tiles, and "scratch space" useful for
  administration, a decent baseline size for GeoNode deployments is 100GB.
* 64-bit hardware recommended.

Installing Dependencies
-----------------------

Some external software must be installed before you can install GeoNode.
The GeoNode package contains both the Java and Django web application code for
GeoNode, but requires some external software installed to complete the GeoNode
platform.

This includes:

* A Python interpreter
* A Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
* Apache Tomcat servlet container
* Python development libraries
* PostgresQL database
* The GDAL, GEOS, and OGR geospatial software libraries

For convenience, appropriate commands to retrieve these dependencies on Ubuntu
14.04 LTS are listed below:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo apt-get install         \
            apache2                \
            gcc                    \
            gdal-bin               \
            gettext                \
            gettext                \
            git-core               \
            libapache2-mod-wsgi    \
            libgeos-dev            \
            libjpeg-dev            \

            postgresql-contrib     \
            python                 \
            python-dev             \
            python-gdal            \

            python-urlgrabber      \
            python-virtualenv      \
            tomcat7                \
            unzip                  \
            zip

.. todo:: is this the complete and up-to-date list of dependencies??

.. note:: Before you copy the command into the terminal and run it, check the
    versions, you might have to adjust them!

.. note:: Be sure that you've installed all the required dependencies before
    you go further with the installation of GeoNode.

Please choose between one of the two methods to finish the
installation-configuration of GeoNode:

#. `Configure using the ubuntu config file`_.
   This is the recommended way, using the provided .sh scripts
#. `Configure manually`_, doing each step by hand as opposed to using the .sh scripts
  
In the end you will have the same running instance of Geonode.

Configure Manually
--------------------

Download Code
'''''''''''''

Download the code using git.

.. code-block:: console

    # download code from github
    $ git clone https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode.git

    # change into the folder called geonde
    $ cd geonode

    # Installs django etc.
    $ sudo pip install -e .

    # Downloads geoserver.war
    $ sudo paver setup

Now if you like to see if all is working so far type:

.. code-block:: console

    # starts everything with default configs! NOT for production!
    $ sudo paver start

    # stops all and you can continue with complete install
    $ sudo paver stop


This will start GeoNode at http://localhost:8000/ with the default configurations, using Jetty as the servlet container and sqlite3 as the database.

.. note:: If running the paver start command produces an "Address already in use" exception for port 8080, try running the paver stop command and then paver start again.  If the exception still occurs then another web server is already bound to that port.  If this is a fresh Ubuntu install then Tomcat was automatically started when you installed the package and you can safely stop it with ``sudo service tomcat7 stop``.

Also GeoNode won't start without using the command above.
To change this, the following configurations of the used components have to be done.


Configure
---------

Complete steps to configure Geonode include the stack:

Servlet Container
    Apache Tomcat for Geoserver
Static File Server
    Apache httpd
Python/WSGI Container
    mod_wsgi
Django Database
    PostgresQL

Configure Postgresql and Postgis
````````````````````````````````

At this point, GeoNode uses *sqlite3* as the default db.
The following steps will show you how to make geonode to use *postgresql* and
*postgis*.

**Create geonode user and database**

First of all a user called ``geonode`` (with password ``geonode``),
as well as a database called ``geonode`` has to be created.

To create the user:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo -u postgres createuser -P geonode

Now you will be asked to enter a password.
This must be ``geonode`` (you can change it if you want to, but be aware that you
have to edit the ``local_settings.py`` if you do so!)

To create the databases (the geonode one and the spatial for shapefile imports):

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo -u postgres createdb -O geonode geonode
    $ sudo -u postgres createdb -O geonode geonode_data
    $ sudo su postgres
    $ psql -d geonode_data -c 'CREATE EXTENSION postgis;'
    $ psql -d geonode_data -c 'GRANT ALL ON geometry_columns TO PUBLIC;'
    $ psql -d geonode_data -c 'GRANT ALL ON spatial_ref_sys TO PUBLIC;'
    $ exit

This creates databases called *geonode* and *geonode_data* 
(which automatically has the postgis extension as well!)
with owner *geonode*.

**Change authentication method**

In the postgres config path, ``/etc/postgresql/9.3/main``, you should find the
file ``pg_hba.conf``.
This file has to be edited in order to allow the geonode user to have access to
the database. Therefore change the directory to this file and open it:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd /etc/postgresql/9.3/main
    $ sudo vi pg_hba.conf

At this point, the file should contain the following default settings:

.. figure:: img/pg_hba_detail.png

and then change the authentication method of the following entry from *peer* to *trust*::

    #TYPE   DATABASE    USER    METHOD
    local   all         all     md5

.. todo:: should be 'trust' not 'md5'?

After changing this file, the ``postgres`` service has to be restarted.
This is essential, because otherwise the changed configurations won't be considered!

To restart the ``postgresql`` server type

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo service postgresql restart

.. note:: service could be also called postgresql-9.1 or postgresql-9.2
        depending on your installation

Additional entry::

    #Type   DATABASE    USER       ADDRESS         METHOD
    host    geonode     geonode    127.0.0.1/32    md5

**Setup local settings**

The next step is to set the local settings.

In the directory ``../geonode/geonode`` a file called
``local_settings.py.sample`` exists.
It includes all the settings to change the default db from ``sqlite3`` to
``postgresql``.
Rename the file to ``local_settings.py``.

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo mv geonode/local_settings.py.sample geonode/local_settings.py

Uncomment line 10 and modify line 12 as follows::

    'ENGINE': 'django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis',
    'NAME': 'geonode_data',

.. note:: If you do not use *geonode* as password for your database,
        then you have to edit the local_settings.py and change your password in
        this part of the file.

Add the following as a directive::

    ALLOWED_HOST = ['domain or IP']

**Synchronise db**

To synchronise the database call the django command ``syncdb``

.. code-block:: console

    $ python manage.py syncdb --noinput --all


Django configurations
`````````````````````

The **Django** frontend can be served in various ways,
one of the most performant is Apache httpd with mod_wsgi installed.

You will also need a web server capable of simply serving static files;
if you are using Apache httpd it can serve this purpose as well.

.. note:: The Django project has further documentation on how to serve Django
        applications at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/howto/deployment/ .

Before the webserver will be configured, some other steps are needed to execute.

**Create new superuser**

A new django superuser has to be created

.. code-block:: console

    $ python manage.py createsuperuser

You will be asked to enter a username, an email address and a password.

**Create local static files**

The ``collectstatic`` command will create a new folder *static_root*.

.. code-block:: console

    $ python manage.py collectstatic

**Enable geonode upload function**

An empty folder called *uploaded* must be created

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo mkdir -p /home/user/geonode/geonode/uploaded

If using apache webserver, change owner to ``www-data``

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo chown www-data -R /home/user/geonode/geonode/uploaded

Webserver configurations (Apache and mod_wsgi)
``````````````````````````````````````````````
**Make apache to load the mod_wsgi module**

If you've done the installation from above,
you should already have a *httpd.conf* file that includes one line:

.. code-block:: ini

    LoadModule wsgi_module /path/to/modules/mod_wsgi.so

.. note:: If you do not already have this,
    then please add this line to ``httpd.conf`` now!

Beside this module you also have to enable the ``proxy`` module.
This can be done very easily using

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo a2enmod proxy_http

We have to create one more configuration file for geonode.
Go to the folder ``sites-available`` and create a file called ``geonode``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
    $ sudo gedit geonode

This file should include the following, but don´t forget to adjust the paths!

.. code-block:: ini

    WSGIDaemonProcess geonode python-path=/home/user/geonode:/home/user/.venvs/geonode/lib/python2.7/site-packages user=www-data threads=15 processes=2

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName http://localhost
        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        DocumentRoot /home/user/geonode/geonode

        ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error.log
        LogLevel warn
        CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access.log combined

        WSGIProcessGroup geonode
        WSGIPassAuthorization On
        WSGIScriptAlias / /home/user/geonode/geonode/wsgi.py

        <Directory "/home/user/geonode/geonode/">
        Order allow,deny
            Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
            Allow from all
            IndexOptions FancyIndexing
        </Directory>

        Alias /static/ /home/user/geonode/geonode/static/
        Alias /uploaded/ /home/user/geonode/geonode/uploaded/

        <Proxy *>
            Order allow,deny
            Allow from all
        </Proxy>

        ProxyPreserveHost On
        ProxyPass /geoserver http://localhost:8080/geoserver
        ProxyPassReverse /geoserver http://localhost:8080/geoserver

    </VirtualHost>

**Enable the new site**

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo a2ensite geonode

This command will create a file *geonode* in the folder *sites-enabled*.

**Now reload apache**

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo service apache2 reload

If you now type ``localhost`` into your webbrowser, the geonode webpage will appear.
You can now login with your newly created superuser account.
But if you visit the django admin interface,
you will only see the content of this webpage without any design.
To change this, you have to change the following entry in our geonode
configuration file:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo gedit /etc/apache2/sites-available/geonode

Change this entry::

    Alias /static/ /home/user/geonode/geonode/static/

to::

    Alias /static/ /home/user/geonode/geonode/static_root/

**Now reload apache2**

again using ``sudo service apache2 reload`` and visit localhost/admin.
Now you should be able to see this:

.. figure:: img/admin_interface.PNG

Change permissions of folders
`````````````````````````````

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo chown www-data:www-data /home/user/geonode/geonode/static/
    $ sudo chown www-data:www-data /home/user/geonode/geonode/uploaded/
    $ sudo chown www-data:www-data /home/user/geonode/geonode/static_root/
    $ sudo service apache2 reload

Configure application server
````````````````````````````

The **GeoServer** web application must be served using a *Java Servlet container*;
two popular and free containers are Jetty and Tomcat.
Jetty is used as default in your GeoNode installation.
Typically a Java web application (WARs) can be deployed by simply copying the
``.war`` file into the appropriate place.
So if you are going to use Tomcat instead, then copy the ``geoserver.war`` file
into Tomcat's webapps directory, as shown in the steps below.

**Deploy your geoserver with Tomcat**

To do so we need Tomcat installed and *not* running.
So if you've got Tomcat running at the moment, stop it:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat7 stop

You can find the ``geoserver.war`` in the folder downloaded in your geonode directory::

    geonode/downloaded/geoserver.war

Now copy this file into the ``webapps`` folder of tomcat:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo mv geonode/downloaded/geoserver.war /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/

By starting tomcat it will unpack the geoserver.war and create a new directory
``tomcat/webapps/geoserver``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat7 start

Let's try to visit http://localhost:8080/geoserver or ``localhost/geoserver``.
You will now see the geoserver homepage:

.. figure:: img/geoserver_webpage.PNG

.. warning:: Geoserver is not a Vanilla Geoserver install, please use the
        geoserver.war that comes with geonode.
        In the future we might use a Vanilla Geoserver, it is being discussed.

GeoNode's GeoServer integration requires some specific extensions to help
GeoNode in managing GeoServer layers.
GeoNode releases include a GeoServer WAR archive with these extensions
pre-installed.
However, some manual configuration may still be needed in case of not standard
installation.

**Configure GeoServer** 

Configure GeoServer with the location of the GeoNode site, used for
authentication (so that GeoServer can recognize logins from the main site).
This setting defaults to http://localhost:8000/, so if you are running the
GeoNode Django application on a different port, or on a different server from
the one running GeoServer, then you will need to change this in two places.

Firstly, by adding a block
of XML to ``WEB-INF/web.xml`` within the unpacked application directory, like
so:

.. code-block:: xml

       <context-param>
           <param-name>GEONODE_BASE_URL</param-name>
           <param-value>http://localhost/</param-value>
       </context-param> 

The ``<param-value>`` tag should enclose the URL to the Django application
homepage.

And secondly, update the value of the ``baseUrl`` tag in 
``data/security/auth/geonodeAuthProvider/config.xml``:

.. code-block:: xml

    <org.geonode.security.GeoNodeAuthProviderConfig>
      <id>-54fbcd7b:1402c24f6bc:-7fe9</id>
      <name>geonodeAuthProvider</name>
      <className>org.geonode.security.GeoNodeAuthenticationProvider</className>
      <baseUrl>http://localhost/</baseUrl>
    </org.geonode.security.GeoNodeAuthProviderConfig>


.. note:: While we intend to provide a detailed, accurate explanation of the
        installation process, if you run into problems with the process
        described in this document, please don't hesitate to let the GeoNode
        team know so we can keep it up to date.

Configure using the Ubuntu config file
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

This is a semi-automatic configuration, involving two .sh scripts.

Download the code using git.

.. code-block:: console

    # download code from github
    $ git clone https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode.git
    $ cd geonode

* Installer configuration file *(located in ``package/support/config-ubuntu.sh``)* 
  This is the first thing to edit.
* The installer script *(located in ``package/install.sh``)*
  Second thing to edit.
 
#. First open the ``package/support/config-ubuntu.sh`` installer configuration file.
   Now provide the details of your installation,
   such as where your webserver looks for documents.

#. Second, open ``install.sh`` and configure to your needs. 

.. note:: you might have to change the postgresql and postgis versions in
    this file, according to the versions you use!

Once edited (if necessary) run the ``./install.sh`` file with the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

    # change into the folder called "package"
    $ cd package

    # run the install.sh with the ubuntu config.sh
    $ sudo ./install.sh support/config-ubuntu.sh

    # call geonode binary django-admin.py create django super user
    $ geonode createsuperuser

    # create the IP address to your address
    $ sudo geonode-updateip youraddress
    

GeoNode can now be accessed at http://localhost
