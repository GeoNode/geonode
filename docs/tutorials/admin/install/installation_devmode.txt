Install GeoNode in development mode
===================================


In order to install Geonode 2.0 in developing mode on Ubuntu 12.04 the following steps are required:

* install build tools and libraries
* install dependencies (Python and Java) and supporting tools
* add PPA repository (for static development)
* set up a virtual environment (virtualenv)
* clone geonode from github and install it in the virtual environment
* compile geoserver and start the development servers 

.. note:: The following steps have to be executed in your terminal. The *Steps 1 – 4a* have to be done as a root user, therefore don´t forget to type sudo in front (as shown in the steps)!

**Step 1**

The first step is to install required build tools and libraries::

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libxml2-dev libxslt-dev

**Step 2**

As known from installing former releases of Geonode, some dependencies and supporting tools have to be installed before Geonode can be set up.

*Python native dependencies*::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-dev python-virtualenv python-imaging python-lxml python-pyproj python-shapely python-nose python-httplib2

*Java dependencies*::

    $ sudo apt-get install -y --force-yes openjdk-6-jdk ant maven2 --no-install-recommends

*supporting tools*::

    $ sudo apt-get install -y git gettext

**Step 3**

Your third step is to add a new PPA repository, which is required for the static development::

    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install nodejs
    $ sudo npm install -g bower
    $ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli

**Step 4** 

Now a virtual environment has to be set up, in which Geonode will later be running. Virtualenv has already been installed during *Step 2 (Python dependencies)*. Now you need to download and install a virutalenvwrapper (*Step 4a*), which has to be added to your environment (*Step 4b*). Before you can download and install Geonode, you have to set up the local virtual environment for Geonode (*Step 4c*).

*Step 4a*::

    $ sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper

*Step 4b*::

    $ export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python
    $ export WORKON_HOME=~/.venvs
    $ source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
    $ export PIP_DOWNLOAD_CACHE=$HOME/.pip-downloads

*Step 4c*::

    $ mkdir your_folder
    $ mkvirtualenv geonode

This creates a new directory where you want your project to be and creates a new virtualenvironment

**Step 5**

To download the latest geonode version from github, the command *clone* is used::

    $ git clone https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode.git

In order to go on and complete the installation you have to direct to your now exisiting geonode folder::

    $ cd geonode

**Step 6**

The last step is to compile GeoServer and start the development servers::

    $ paver setup
    $ paver start

Now you should be able to visit the geonode site by typing http://localhost:8000 into your browser window.

To stop the server::

    $ Ctrl c
    $ paver stop
    
**Restart server**

With every restart of your machine, you have to restart geonode as well. That means, you will not be able to open http://localhost:8000 directly after starting your machine new. In order to be able to use geonode now, you have to activate your virtualenvironment and to start the development servers. 

.. note:: *your_name* is the name of your machine and personal folder!

#. Activate virtualenv
 
   To activate your virtualenv you just need to type::
   
       $ source /home/your_name/.venvs/geonode/bin/activate

   .. note:: Be careful with this, you might have another path, so check first where your virtualenv has been installed!

#. Start the server
  
   To start the server go to your geonode folder::
   
       $ cd geonode
   
   and then run::
   
       $ paver start_geoserver
       $ paver start_django

   Now you are able to access http://localhost:8000 again.

.. note:: Remember that you have to do these steps each time you restart your machine!!

**Next step**

Create a superuser so you can log on to your local geonode installation at http://localhost:8000

.. code-block:: console

    $ django-admin.py createsuperuser –-settings=geonode.settings
