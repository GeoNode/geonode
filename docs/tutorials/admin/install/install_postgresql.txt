Installation of Postgresql-9.2 on Ubuntu 12.04 
==============================================

Installation
------------

The Installation of Postgresql-9.2 on Ubuntu 12.04 includes two main steps (Generally, this installation should work for each version of Postgresql!). 

#. **Add repository to list**

   Create an empty file called *pgdg.list* placed in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/, using these commands

   .. code-block:: console

	   $ cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
	   $ sudo touch pgdg.list

   Now the following line has to be included the *pgdg.list* file.

   .. code-block:: console

	   deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ codename-pgdg main

   Instead of *codename* write the name of your system. If you do not know this, type

   .. code-block:: console

	   $ lsb_release -c

   This will return you the name of your system.

   .. warning:: Make sure that you have changed *codename* to the name of your system before you copy the link in the next step!

   Now open the *pgdg.list* file using e.g.:

   .. code-block:: console

	   $ gksu gedit pdgd.list

   and copy deb `http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ codename-pgdg main` into it.

#. **Import Repository key**

   Use the following command to do so:

   .. code-block:: console

	   $ wget --quiet -O - http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -

   After that you have to update the package lists using

   .. code-block:: console

	   $ sudo apt-get update

   and then you can install postgresql-9.2 and pgadmin3 (if needed)

   .. code-block:: console

	   $ sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.2 pgadmin3


Configuration
-------------

**General**

#. *Change password*

   First of all you have to set a new password for the superuser *postgres*. In order to do so, type the following command line into your terminal

   .. code-block:: console

	$ sudo -u postgres psql postgres

   Now you are in *psql*, the command interface for postgresql, and in the database *postgres*. In your terminal it looks like this at the moment

   .. code-block:: console

	$ postgres=#

   To change your password::

	$ \password postgres

   and type your new password when asked for it.

#. *Create a database* (for testing)

   If you want to create a db, posgresql has to know, which user you are. Therefore you have to type `-u username` in front of the command `createdb`. If you type the following, it means that you as the user *postgres* want to create a database wich is called *mydb*.

   .. code-block:: console

	$ sudo -u postgres createdb mydb

**For geonode**

   If you do not need that (from the beginning) you can follow this instruction. You can even add the *posgis extension* later following the
   steps from the section *Alternative*. Anyway it is recommended to do the common version. 


#. *Create a new user (geonode)*

   In order to use postgresql in geonode, you have to create a new user *geonode*, which is the owner of a new database, also called *geonode*. So first create a new user by typing

   .. code-block:: console
	
	$ sudo -u postgres createuser -P geonode

   This means, that you as the user *postgres* create a new user called *geonode*. `-P` indicates, that this user will have a password (*geonode*). 

#. *Create new database*

   After creating the new user you can create the db *geonode*:

   .. code-block:: console

	$ sudo -u postgres createdb -O geonode geonode
