Complete Installation Guide
===========================

The manual installation is intended for those who are comfortable with Linux system administration.


.. note:: Here is the link to our :ref:`quick_installation` .

Recommended Minimum System Requirements
---------------------------------------

For deployment of GeoNode on a single server, the following are the *bare minimum* system requirements:

* 6GB of RAM, including swap space.
* 2.2GHz processor.  (Additional processing power may be required for multiple concurrent styling renderings)
* 1 GB software disk usage.
* Additional disk space for any data hosted with GeoNode and tiles cached with GeoWebCache.
  For spatial data, cached tiles, and "scratch space" useful for administration, a decent baseline size for GeoNode deployments is 100GB.
* 64-bit hardware recommended.

Step 1 Installing Dependencies
------------------------------

Some external software must be installed before you can install GeoNode. The GeoNode package contains both the Java and Django web application code for GeoNode, but requires some external software installed to complete the GeoNode platform.

This includes:

* A Python interpreter
* A Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
* Apache Tomcat servlet container
* Python development libraries
* PostgresQL database
* The GDAL, GEOS, and OGR geospatial software libraries

For convenience, appropriate commands to retrieve these dependencies on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS are listed below::

    $ sudo apt-get install python python-support python-dev python-virtualenv openjdk-6-jre tomcat7 postgresql-9.1 postgresql-contrib-9.1 gcc patch zip python-imaging gdal-bin libgeos-dev python-urlgrabber python-pastescript gettext postgresql-contrib postgresql-9.1-postgis libpq-dev unzip libjpeg-dev libpng-dev python-gdal libproj-dev python-psycopg2 apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi git-core gettext libxml2-dev libxslt-dev

.. todo:: is this the complete and up-to-date list of dependencies??

Beware that in case of use of postgres 9.2 as described in :ref:`install_postgresql` and :ref:`install_postgis` all the postgres and postgis references must be removed from the above command!

.. note:: Before you copy the command into the terminal and run it, check the versions, you might have to adjust them!

.. note:: Be sure that you've installed all the required dependencies before you go further with the installation of GeoNode.

Step 2 Download Code
--------------------

Download the code using git.

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode.git      	# download code from github
    $ cd geonode                            			# change into the folder called geonde
    $ sudo pip install -e .					# this installs django etc.
    $ sudo paver setup						# this downloads geoserver.war

Now if you like to see if all is working so far type:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo paver start						# starts everything with default configs! NOT for production!
    $ sudo paver stop						# stops all and you can continue with complete install


This will start GeoNode at http://localhost/. But until now, GeoNode is running with the default configurations, e.g it uses Jetty as servlet container and sqlite3 as database. Also GeoNode won't start without using the command above. Changing this, the following 		configurations on the used components have to be done.


Step 3 Configure
----------------

Final steps to configure Geonode include the stack:

* *Servlet Container*: Apache Tomcat for Geoserver
* *Static File Server*: Apache httpd
* *Python/WSGI Container*: mod_wsgi
* *Django Database*: PostgresQL

Please choose between one of the two methods to finish the installation-configuration of GeoNode:

  #. Configure using the ubuntu config file, this is the recommended way using the provided .sh scripts
  #. Configure manually, doing each step by hand as opposed to using the .sh scripts
  
  In the end you will have the same running instance of Geonode.

#. **Configure using the ubuntu config file**


    This is a semi-automatic configuration script involving two .sh scripts.
    
     * Installer configuration file **(located in package/support/config-ubuntu.sh)**  First thing to edit
     * The installer script **(located in package/  		install.sh)**     Second thing to edit
     
    #. First open the package/support/config-ubuntu.sh installer configuration file. Now provide the details of your installation, such as where your webserver looks for documents.
    
    #. Second open the install.sh and configure to your needs. 
    
    .. note:: you might have to change the postgresql 		and postgis version in this file, according to the versions you use!

    Once edited (if necessary) run the ./install.sh file with the following commands::

        $ cd package					                               # change into the folder called "package"
        $ sudo ./install.sh support/config-ubuntu.sh			       	       # run the install.sh with the ubuntu config.sh
        $ sudo cp downloaded/geoserver.war /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps		       # copy geoserver.war into tomcat webapps directory
        $ sudo geonode-updateip youraddress					       # create the IP address to your address
        $ geonode createsuperuser					               # call geonode binary django-admin.py create django super user

    GeoNode can now be accessed at http://localhost


#. **Configure Manually**


        .. note:: If the server has a fresh Ubuntu installation it’s strongly suggested instead to adjust the *package/support/config-ubuntu.sh* script to match the desired installation paths.


   #. **Configure Postgresql and Postgis**

       Until now GeoNode uses sqlite3 as the default db. The following steps will show you how to make geonode to use postgresql and postgis.

           **Create geonode user and database**

           First of all a user called *geonode* (with password *geonode*), as well as a database called *geonode* has to be created.

           To create the user:

           .. code-block:: console

                   $ sudo -u postgres createuser -P geonode

           Now you will be asked to enter a password. This must be *geonode* (you can change it if you want to, but be aware that you 			have to edit the local_settings.py if you do so!)

           To create the databases (the geonode one and the spatial for shapefile imports):

           .. code-block:: console

		$ sudo -u postgres createdb -O geonode geonode
                $ sudo -u postgres createdb -O geonode geonode-imports
                $ sudo su postgres
                $ psql -f /usr/share/postgresql/9.1/contrib/postgis-1.5/postgis.sql geonode-imports
                $ psql -f /usr/share/postgresql/9.1/contrib/postgis-1.5/spatial_ref_sys.sql geonode-imports
                $ psql -d geonode-imports -c 'GRANT ALL ON geometry_columns TO PUBLIC;'
                $ psql -d geonode-imports -c 'GRANT ALL ON spatial_ref_sys TO PUBLIC;'
                $ exit


           This creates a db called *geonode* and *geonode-imports* (which automatically has the postgis extension as well!) with owner 			*geonode*.


           **Change authentication method**

           In the postgres config path, */etc/postgresql/9.2/main*, you should find the file *pg_hba.conf*. This file has to be edited in 			order to allow the geonode user to have access to the database. Therfore change the directory to this file and open it

           .. code-block:: console

		$ cd /etc/postgresql/9.1/main
                $ sudo vi pg_hba.conf

           The file should contain the following default settings until now:

           .. figure:: img/pg_hba_detail.png

           and then set the authentication method of the following entry from *peer* to *trust*::

                   #TYPE	DATABASE    USER    METHOD
                   local   all	    all     md5

           After changing this file, the postgres service has to be restarted. This is essential, because otherwise the changed 			configurations won't be considered!

           To restart the postgresql server type

           .. code-block:: console

                   $ sudo service postgresql restart

           .. note:: service could be also called postgresql-9.1 or postgresql-9.2 depending on your installation

           Additional entry::

                   #Type   DATABASE    USER    ADDRESS     METHOD
                   host    geonode     geonode 127.0.0.1/32    md5

           **Setup local settings**

           The next step is to set the local settings.

           In the directory ../geonode/geonode a file called *local_settings.py.sample* exists. It includes all the 			settings to change the default db from *sqlite3* to *postgresql*. Rename the file to *local_settings.py*.

           .. code-block:: console

                   $ sudo mv geonode/local_settings.py.sample geonode/local_settings.py

           Uncomment the line 10 and modify the line 12 as follows::

               'ENGINE': 'django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis',
               'NAME': 'geonode-imports',

               .. note:: If you do not use *geonode* as password for your database, then you have to edit the local_settings.py and change 			your password in this part of the file

           Add the following as a directive::

                   ALLOWED_HOST = ['domain or IP']

           **Synchronise db**

           To synchronise the database call the django command *syncdb*

           .. code-block:: console

                   $ python manage.py syncdb --noinput --all


   #. **Django configurations**

       The **Django** frontend can be served in various ways, one of the most performant is Apache httpd with mod_wsgi installed.

           You will also need a web server capable of simply serving static files; if you are using Apache httpd it can serve this purpose as 		well.

       .. note:: The Django project has further documentation on how to serve Django applications at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/howto/deployment/ .

       Before the webserver will be configured, some other steps are needed to execute.

           **Create new superuser**

           A new django superuser has to be created

           .. code-block:: console

               $ python manage.py createsuperuser

           You will be asked to enter a username, an email adress and a password.

           **Create local static files**

           The collectstatic command will create a new folder *static_root*.

           .. code-block:: console

               $ python manage.py collectstatic

           **Enable geonode upload function**

           An empty folder called *uploaded* must be created

           .. code-block:: console

               $ sudo mkdir -p /home/user/geonode/geonode/uploaded

           When using apache webserver change owner to www-data

           .. code-block:: console

               $ sudo chown www-data -R /home/user/geonode/geonode/uploaded

   #. **Webserver configurations (Apache and mod_wsgi)**

           **Make apache to load the mod_wsgi module**

           If you've done the installation from above, you should already have a *httpd.conf* file that includes one line

           .. code-block:: python

                   LoadModule wsgi_module /path/to/modules/mod_wsgi.so

            .. note:: If you do not already have this, then please add this line to *httpd.conf* now!

           Beside this module you also have to enable the proxy module. This can be done very easily using

           .. code-block:: console

                   $ sudo a2enmod proxy_http

           We have to create one more configuration file for geonode. Go to the folder *sites-available* and create a file called 			*geonode*

           .. code-block:: console

                   $ cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
                   $ sudo gedit geonode

           This file should inlcude the following, but don´t forget to adjust the paths!

           .. code-block:: python

                   WSGIDaemonProcess geonode python-path=/home/user/geonode:/home/user/.venvs/geonode/lib/python2.7/site-packages user=www-data threads=15 processes=2

                       ServerName http://localhost
                       ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
                       DocumentRoot /home/user/geonode/geonode

                       ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error.log
                       LogLevel warn
                       CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access.log combined

                       WSGIProcessGroup geonode
                       WSGIPassAuthorization On
                       WSGIScriptAlias / /home/user/geonode/geonode/wsgi.py

                       <Directory "/home/user/geonode/geonode/">
                       Order allow,deny
                           Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
                           Allow from all
                           IndexOptions FancyIndexing
                       </Directory>

                       Alias /static/ /home/user/geonode/geonode/static/
                       Alias /uploaded/ /home/user/geonode/geonode/uploaded/

                       <Proxy *>
                           Order allow,deny
                           Allow from all
                       </Proxy>

                       ProxyPreserveHost On
                       ProxyPass /geoserver http://localhost:8080/geoserver
                       ProxyPassReverse /geoserver http://localhost:8080/geoserver

                   </VirtualHost>

           **Enable the new site**

           .. code-block:: console

                   $ sudo a2ensite geonode

           This command will create a file *geonode* in the folder *sites-enabled*.

           **Now reload apache**

           .. code-block:: console

                   $ sudo service apache2 reload

           If you now type localhost into your webbrowser, the geonode webpage will appear. You can now login with your newly created 			superuser account. But if you try to attend the django admin interface, you will only see the content of this webpage but 			without any design. To change this, you have to change the following entry in our geonode configuration file

           .. code-block:: console

                   $ sudo gedit /etc/apache2/sites-available/geonode

           Change this entry::

                   Alias /static/ /home/user/geonode/geonode/static/

           to::

                   Alias /static/ /home/user/geonode/geonode/static_root/

           **Now reload apache2**

           again using ``sudo service apache2 reload`` and visit localhost/admin. Now you should be able to see this

           .. figure:: img/admin_interface.PNG

   #. **Change permissions of folders**

       .. code-block:: console

               $ sudo chown www-data:www-data /home/user/geonode/geonode/static/
               $ sudo chown www-data:www-data /home/user/geonode/geonode/uploaded/
               $ sudo chown www-data:www-data /home/user/geonode/geonode/static_root/

               $ sudo service apache2 reload

   #. **Configure application server**

       The **GeoServer** web application must be served using a *Java Servlet container*; two popular and free containers are Jetty and 	 Tomcat. Jetty is used as default in your GeoNode installation. Typically a Java web application (WARs) can be deployed by simply 	 copying the .war file into the appropriate place. So if you are going to use Tomcat instead, then copy the geoserver.war file into 		Tomcats webapps directory, as shown in the steps below.

           **Deploy your geoserver with Tomcat**

           To do so we need Tomcat installed and *not* running. So if you've got Tomcat running at the moment, stop it

           .. code-block:: console

                   $ sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat7 stop

           You can find the *geoserver.war* in the folder downloaded in your geonode directory::

                   geonode/downloaded/geoserver.war

           Now copy this file into the *webapps* folder of tomcat

           .. code-block:: console

                $ sudo mv geonode/downloaded/geoserver.war /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/

           By starting tomcat it will unpack the geoserver.war and create a new directory ``tomcat/webapps/geoserver``.

           .. code-block:: console

                   $ sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat7 start

           Let´s try to attend http://localhost:8080/geoserver or localhost/geoserver. You will now see the geoserver homepage.

           .. figure:: img/geoserver_webpage.PNG


       .. warning:: Geoserver is not a Vanilla Geoserver install, please use the geoserver.war that comes with geonode. In the future we might use a Vanilla Geoserver, it is in discussion


   GeoNode's GeoServer integration requires some specific extensions to help
   GeoNode in managing GeoServer layers.  GeoNode releases include a GeoServer WAR
   archive with these extensions pre-installed.  However, some manual
   configuration may still be needed in case of not standard installation.

    #. *Configure* GeoServer with the location of the GeoNode site, used for
       authentication (so that GeoServer can recognize logins from the main site).
       This setting defaults to http://localhost:8000/, so if you are running
       the GeoNode Django application on a different port, or on a different server
       from the one running GeoServer, then you will need to change this by adding
       a block of XML to ``WEB-INF/web.xml`` within the unpacked application
       directory, like so::

          <context-param>
              <param-name>GEONODE_BASE_URL</param-name>
              <param-value>http://localhost/</param-value>
          </context-param> 
   
      The ``<param-value>`` tag should enclose the URL to the Django application
      homepage.
   

   .. note:: While we intend to provide a detailed, accurate explanation of the installation process, if you run into problems with the process described in this document, please don't hesitate to let the GeoNode team know so we can keep it up to date.
