Introduction
============

This tutorial will guide you through several different tasks of the GeoNode administration.
From the installation and configuration to management, monitoring and restoring, the aim of this guide is to make the administrator fully aware of how GeoNode works and of the ways in which it can be manipulated.

The general suggestion is to try all of these guides on a clean Ubuntu 12.04 machine or virtual machine.
