Backup & Restore GeoNode - Data Migration
=========================================

The admin command to backup and restore GeoNode, allows to extract consistently the GeoNode and GeoServer data models in a serializable meta-format which is being interpreted later by the restore procedure in order to exactly rebuild the whole structure, 
according to the current instance version (which may also be different from the starting one).

In particular the tool helps developers and admins to correctly extract and serialize the following resources are on the storage and deserialize on the target GeoNode/GeoServer instance:

* **GeoNode** (Resource Base Model):

    #. Layers (both raster and vectors)

    #. Maps

    #. Documents

    #. People with Credentials

    #. Permissions

    #. Associated Styles
    
    #. Static data and templates

* **GeoServer** (Catalog):

    #. OWS Services configuration and limits

    #. Security model along with auth filters configuration, users and credentials

    #. Workspaces

    #. Stores (both DataStores and CoverageStores)

    #. Layers

    #. Styles

The tool exposes two GeoNode Management Commands, 'backup' and 'restore'.

The commands allow to:

#. Fully backup GeoNode data and fixtures on a zip archive

#. Fully backup GeoServer configuration (physical datasets - tables, shapefiles, geotiffs)

#. Fully restore GeoNode and GeoServer fixtures and catalog from the zip archive

#. Migrate fixtures from old GeoNode models to the new one

The usage of those commands is quite easy and straight. It is possible to run the backup and restore commands from the GeoNode Admin panel also.

The first step is to ensure that everything is correctly configured and the requisites respected in order to successfully perform a backup and restore of GeoNode.

.. warning:: It is worth notice that this functionality requires the latest `GeoServer Extension <http://build.geonode.org/geoserver/latest/>`_ (2.9.x or greater) for GeoNode in order to correctly work.

.. note:: GeoServer full documentation is also available here `GeoServer Docs <http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/community/backuprestore/index.html>`_

Requisites and Setup
====================

**Before** running a GeoNode backup / restore, it is necessary to ensure everything is correctly configured and setup.

Settings
--------

Accordingly to the admin needs, the file ``settings.ini`` must be tuned up a bit before running a backup / restore.

It can be found at ``geonode/base/management/commands/settings.ini`` and by default it contains the following properties:

.. code-block:: ini

    [database]
    pgdump = pg_dump
    pgrestore = pg_restore

    [geoserver]
    datadir = /opt/gs_data_dir
    dumpvectordata = yes
    dumprasterdata = yes

    [fixtures]
    #NOTE: Order is important
    apps   = people,account,avatar.avatar,base.backup,base.license,base.topiccategory,base.region,base.resourcebase,base.contactrole,base.link,base.restrictioncodetype,base.spatialrepresentationtype,guardian.userobjectpermission,guardian.groupobjectpermission,layers.uploadsession,layers.style,layers.layer,layers.attribute,layers.layerfile,maps.map,maps.maplayer,maps.mapsnapshot,documents.document,taggit

    dumps  = people,accounts,avatars,backups,licenses,topiccategories,regions,resourcebases,contactroles,links,restrictioncodetypes,spatialrepresentationtypes,useropermissions,groupopermissions,uploadsessions,styles,layers,attributes,layerfiles,maps,maplayers,mapsnapshots,documents,tags

    # Migrate from GN 2.0 to GN 2.4
    #migrations = base.resourcebase,layers.layer,layers.attribute,maps.map,maps.maplayer
    #manglers   = gn20_to_24.ResourceBaseMangler,gn20_to_24.LayerMangler,gn20_to_24.LayerAttributesMangler,gn20_to_24.MapMangler,gn20_to_24.MapLayersMangler

    # Migrate from GN 2.4 to GN 2.4
    migrations = base.resourcebase,layers.layer,layers.attribute,maps.map,maps.maplayer
    manglers   = gn24_to_24.ResourceBaseMangler,gn24_to_24.LayerMangler,gn24_to_24.LayerAttributesMangler,gn24_to_24.DefaultMangler,gn24_to_24.MapLayersMangler

The ``settings.ini`` has few different sections that must carefully checked before running a backup / restore command.

Settings: [database] Section
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: ini

    [database]
    pgdump = pg_dump
    pgrestore = pg_restore

This section is quite simple. It contains only two (2) properties:

* *pgdump*; the path of the ``pg_dump`` local command.

* *pgrestore*; the path of the ``pg_restore`` local command.

.. warning:: Those properties are ignored in case GeoNode is not configured to use a DataBase as backend (see ``settings.py`` and ``local_settings.py`` sections)

.. note:: Database connection settings (both for GeoNode and GeoServer) will be taken from ``settings.py`` and ``local_settings.py`` configuration files. Be sure they are correctly configured (on the target GeoNode instance too) and the DataBase server is accessible while executing a backup / restore command.

Settings: [geoserver] Section
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: ini

    [geoserver]
    datadir = /opt/gs_data_dir
    dumpvectordata = yes
    dumprasterdata = yes

This section allows to enable / disable a full data backup / restore of GeoServer.

* *datadir*; the full path of GeoServer Data Dir, by default ``/opt/gs_data_dir``. The path **must** be accessible and **fully writable** by the ``geonode`` and / or ``httpd server`` users when executing a backup / restore command.

* *dumpvectordata*; a boolean allowing to disable dump of vectorial data from GeoServer (shapefiles or DB tables). If ``false`` (or ``no``) vectorial data won't be stored / re-stored.

* *dumprasterdata*; a boolean allowing to disable dump of raster data from GeoServer (geotiffs). If ``false`` (or ``no``) raster data won't be stored / re-stored.

.. warning:: Enabling those options **requires** that the GeoServer Data Dir is accessible and **fully writable** by the ``geonode`` and / or ``httpd server`` users when executing a backup / restore command.

Settings: [fixtures] Section
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: ini

    [fixtures]
    #NOTE: Order is important
    apps   = people,account,avatar.avatar,base.backup,base.license,base.topiccategory,base.region,base.resourcebase,base.contactrole,base.link,base.restrictioncodetype,base.spatialrepresentationtype,guardian.userobjectpermission,guardian.groupobjectpermission,layers.uploadsession,layers.style,layers.layer,layers.attribute,layers.layerfile,maps.map,maps.maplayer,maps.mapsnapshot,documents.document,taggit

    dumps  = people,accounts,avatars,backups,licenses,topiccategories,regions,resourcebases,contactroles,links,restrictioncodetypes,spatialrepresentationtypes,useropermissions,groupopermissions,uploadsessions,styles,layers,attributes,layerfiles,maps,maplayers,mapsnapshots,documents,tags

    # Migrate from GN 2.0 to GN 2.4
    #migrations = base.resourcebase,layers.layer,layers.attribute,maps.map,maps.maplayer
    #manglers   = gn20_to_24.ResourceBaseMangler,gn20_to_24.LayerMangler,gn20_to_24.LayerAttributesMangler,gn20_to_24.MapMangler,gn20_to_24.MapLayersMangler

    # Migrate from GN 2.4 to GN 2.4
    migrations = base.resourcebase,layers.layer,layers.attribute,maps.map,maps.maplayer
    manglers   = gn24_to_24.ResourceBaseMangler,gn24_to_24.LayerMangler,gn24_to_24.LayerAttributesMangler,gn24_to_24.DefaultMangler,gn24_to_24.MapLayersMangler

This section is the most complex one. Usually you don't need to modify it. Only an expert user who knows Python and GeoNode model structure should modify this section.

What its properties mean:

* *apps*; this is an ordered list of GeoNode Object Models (or DJango apps). The backup / restore procedure will dump / restore the fixtures in a portable format.

* *dumps*; this is the list of ``files`` associated to the Django apps. The order **must** be the same of the property above. Each name represents the ``file name`` where to dump / read the single app fixture.

* *migrations*; some fixtures must be enriched or updated before restored on the target model. This section allows to associate specific manglers to the fixtures. Manglers are simple Python classes which simply converts some attributes to other formats.

* *manglers*; the Python mangler class to execute accordingly to the fixture indicated by the *migrations* property. Manglers classes **must** be located into he `geonode/base/management/commands/lib`` folder.

.. note:: Manglers **must** be used when migrating from a GeoNode version to another one, i.e. where the original model differs from the target one. With the default distribution are provided manglers to convert from GeoNode 2.0 to GeoNode 2.4. Other versions may require other manglers or updates to the default ones.

Mangler Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As specified on the section above, manglers are Python classes allowing developers to enrich / modify a fixture in order to fit the target GeoNode model.

The structure of a mangler is quite simple. Lets examine the ``ResourceBaseMangler`` of the ``gn_20_to_24`` library, a mangler used to convert a GeoNode 2.0 Resource Base to a GeoNode 2.4 one.

.. code-block:: python

    class ResourceBaseMangler(DefaultMangler):

        def default(self, obj):
            # Let the base class default method raise the TypeError
            return json.JSONEncoder.default(self, obj)

        def decode(self, json_string):
            """
            json_string is basically a string that you give to json.loads method
            """
            default_obj = super(ResourceBaseMangler, self).decode(json_string)

            # manipulate your object any way you want
            # ....
            upload_sessions = []
            for obj in default_obj:
                obj['pk'] = obj['pk'] + self.basepk

                obj['fields']['featured'] = False
                obj['fields']['rating'] = 0
                obj['fields']['popular_count'] = 0
                obj['fields']['share_count'] = 0
                obj['fields']['is_published'] = True
                obj['fields']['thumbnail_url'] = ''

                if 'distribution_url' in obj['fields']:
                    if not obj['fields']['distribution_url'] is None and 'layers' in obj['fields']['distribution_url']:

                        obj['fields']['polymorphic_ctype'] = ["layers", "layer"]

                        try:
                            p = '(?P<protocol>http.*://)?(?P<host>[^:/ ]+).?(?P<port>[0-9]*)(?P<details_url>.*)'
                            m = re.search(p, obj['fields']['distribution_url'])
                            if 'http' in m.group('protocol'):
                                obj['fields']['detail_url'] = self.siteurl + m.group('details_url')
                            else:
                                obj['fields']['detail_url'] = self.siteurl + obj['fields']['distribution_url']
                        except:
                            obj['fields']['detail_url'] = obj['fields']['distribution_url']

                    else:
                        obj['fields']['polymorphic_ctype'] = ["maps", "map"]

                try:
                    obj['fields'].pop("distribution_description", None)
                except:
                    pass

                try:
                    obj['fields'].pop("distribution_url", None)
                except:
                    pass

                try:
                    obj['fields'].pop("thumbnail", None)
                except:
                    pass

                upload_sessions.append(self.add_upload_session(obj['pk'], obj['fields']['owner']))

            default_obj.extend(upload_sessions)

            return default_obj

        def add_upload_session(self, pk, owner):
            obj = dict()

            obj['pk'] = pk
            obj['model'] = 'layers.uploadsession'

            obj['fields'] = dict()
            obj['fields']['user'] = owner
            obj['fields']['traceback'] = None
            obj['fields']['context'] = None
            obj['fields']['error'] = None
            obj['fields']['processed'] = True
            obj['fields']['date'] = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S")

            return obj

#. It extends the ``DefaultMangler``.

    The ``DefaultMangler`` is a basic class implementing a JSONDecoder
    
        .. code-block:: python
    
            class DefaultMangler(json.JSONDecoder):

                def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):

                    self.basepk = kwargs.get('basepk', -1)
                    self.owner = kwargs.get('owner', 'admin')
                    self.datastore = kwargs.get('datastore', '')
                    self.siteurl = kwargs.get('siteurl', '')

                    super(DefaultMangler, self).__init__(*args)

                def default(self, obj):
                    # Let the base class default method raise the TypeError
                    return json.JSONEncoder.default(self, obj)

                def decode(self, json_string):
                    """
                    json_string is basicly string that you give to json.loads method
                    """
                    default_obj = super(DefaultMangler, self).decode(json_string)

                    # manipulate your object any way you want
                    # ....

                    return default_obj

    By default this mangler unmarshalls GeoNode Object Model from JSON and returns it to the management command.
    
    The GeoNode Object Model can be modified while decoding by extending the ``def decode(self, json_string)`` method.
    
    * *json_string*; actual parameter contains the JSON representation of the fixture.
    
    * *default_obj*; is the Python object decoded from the JSON representation of the fixture.
    
#. It overrides the ``def decode(self, json_string)`` method.

    The decoded Python object can be enriched / modified before returning it to the management command.

From Command Line
=================

The following sections shows instructions on how to perform backup / restore from the command line by using the Admin Management Commands.

In order to obtain a basic user guide for the management command from the command line, just run

    .. code-block:: shell

        python manage.py backup --help
        
        python manage.py restore --help
        
``--help`` will provide the list of available command line options with a brief description.

It is worth notice that both commands allows the following option

    .. code-block:: shell

        python manage.py backup --force / -f
        
        python manage.py restore --force / -f
    
Which will instruct the management command to not ask for confirmation from the user. It enables basically a non-interactive mode.
    
Backup
------

In order to perform a backup just run the command:

    .. code-block:: shell

        python manage.py backup --backup-dir=<target_bk_folder_path>

The management command will automatically generate a ``.zip`` archive file on the target folder in case of success.

Restore
-------

In order to perform a restore just run the command:

    .. code-block:: shell

        python manage.py restore --backup-file=<target_restore_file_path>

Restore requires the path of one ``.zip`` archive containing the backup fixtures.

.. warning:: The Restore will **overwrite** the whole target GeoNode / GeoServer users, catalog and database, so be very careful.

From GeoNode Admin GUI
======================

#. Login as ``admin`` and click on ``Admin`` menu option

    .. figure:: img/backup001.png
    
#. Look for ``Backups`` on ``Base`` section

    .. figure:: img/backup002.png
    
#. Add a new backup

    .. figure:: img/backup003.png
    
#. Insert a ``Name`` and a ``Description``; also you **must** provide the ``Base folder`` where the backups will be stored

    .. figure:: img/backup004.png
    
    .. warning:: the ``Base folder`` **must** be **fully writable** from both ``geonode`` and ``httpd server`` system users.
    
#. Click on ``save`` and go back to the Backups list main section

    .. figure:: img/backup005.png
    
#. The new Backup is not **ready** until you perform the ``Run Backup`` action; in order to do that select the backup to run and from the ``Action`` menu select ``Run the Backup``

    .. figure:: img/backup006.png
    
    .. note:: A Backup is not *ready* until the ``Location`` attribute is filled
    
              .. figure:: img/backup007.png
    
#. Click on ``Yes, I'msure`` on the next section in order to perform the Backup

    .. figure:: img/backup008.png
    
    .. note:: The server page will wait for the Backup to finish (or fail).
    
#. The server page will wait for the Backup to finish (or fail); at the end of the Backup you will be redirected to the main list page.

    .. figure:: img/backup009.png
    
    .. note:: At a successfull run, the ``Location`` attribute is filled with the full path of the backup archive
    
              .. figure:: img/backup010.png

    .. warning:: A Backup can always being updated later and / or executed again. The ``Location`` attribute will be updated accorndingly.
    
#. Execute as many Backups as you want; they can all point to the same ``Base Folder``, the new backups will generate new unique archive files any time.

    .. figure:: img/backup011.png
    
#. In order to Restore a zip archive, just select the instance to restore from the list and from the ``Action`` menu lunch the ``Run the Restore`` option.

    .. figure:: img/backup012.png
    
#. Click on ``Yes, I'msure`` on the next section in order to perform the Backup

    .. figure:: img/backup008.png
    
    .. note:: The server page will wait for the Backup to finish (or fail).

.. warning:: The following target GeoNode folders **must** be **fully writable** from both ``geonode`` and ``httpd server`` system users

             * geoserver_data_dir/data
             * geonode / settings.MEDIA_ROOT
             * geonode / settings.STATIC_ROOT
             * geonode / settings.STATICFILES_DIRS
             * geonode / settings.TEMPLATE_DIRS
             * geonode / settings.LOCALE_PATHS

.. warning:: The Restore will **overwrite** the whole target GeoNode / GeoServer users, catalog and database, so be very careful.
