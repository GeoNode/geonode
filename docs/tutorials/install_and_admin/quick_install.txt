Quick Installation Guide
========================

The following is a quick guide to get GeoNode up and running in most common operating systems.
This is meant to be run on a fresh machine with no previously installed packages or GeoNode versions.

Recommended Minimum System Requirements
=======================================

For deployment of GeoNode on a single server, the following are the *bare minimum* system requirements:

* 6GB of RAM, including swap space.
* 2.2GHz processor. (Additional processing power may be required for multiple concurrent styling renderings)
* 1 GB software disk usage.
* Additional disk space for any data hosted with GeoNode and tiles cached with GeoWebCache.
  For spatial data, cached tiles, and "scratch space" useful for administration, a decent baseline size for GeoNode deployments is 100GB.
* 64-bit hardware recommended.


Linux
=====

Ubuntu (standard deployment)
----------------------------

The easiest way to get the .deb is to install it using APT, the standard installation management tool for Ubuntu. The current release, 2.4 is available only for Ubuntu 14.04.

These instructions have been tested on a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS 64 bit server edition. Please ensure the latest packages are installed with::

    sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade

Amongst other things, this will ensure that the ``software-properties-common`` package is installed, which is required to make the ``add-apt-repository`` command used below available.

The steps to install geonode and all dependencies in Ubuntu 14.04 are as follows:

1. Set up the GeoNode PPA repository (you only need to do this once; the repository will still be available for upgrades later)::

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:geonode/stable

2. Install the geonode package and dependencies::

    sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install geonode

3. Set the correct IP address (NB: the first command below looks up the IP address automatically)::

    IP_ADDRESS=$(ip route get 8.8.8.8 | awk '{print $NF; exit}')
    sudo geonode-updateip $IP_ADDRESS
   
   NB: The IP address must be set to enable access from another machine, e.g. the host machine if geonode is installed in a virtual machine.
    
4. Create a geonode superuser, which is used in the geonode web application. You will be prompted for a username, email and password::

    geonode createsuperuser

5. Access geonode from your web browser, using the IP address from step 3 above. The neonode web applicaiton should be displayed and you can log in using the superuser details entered immediately above::

    http://[IP_ADDRESS]

NB: With this installation method you use ``sudo geonode xxxx`` in place of any ``python manage.py xxx`` command referred to in documentation. For example, try::

    sudo geonode help   

For further information, read the Admin Docs at http://docs.geonode.org/en/master/#for-administrators.

Ubuntu (for development)
---------------------------------

This option installs geonode in a virtual environment. This option is very useful in case you want to develop using Ubuntu (tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS)::

    # Install Ubuntu dependencies
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv python-dev libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev libjpeg-dev libpq-dev libgdal-dev git default-jdk

    # Install Java 8 (needed by latest GeoServer 2.9)
    sudo apt-add-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer

    # Create and activate the virtulenv
    virtualenv --no-site-packages env
    source env/bin/activate

    # git clone geonode
    git clone https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode
    cd geonode

    # Install pip dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -e .
    
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ppa && sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install gdal-bin
    # check GDAL version
    gdalinfo --version
    
    # install the correct PyGDAL version (>1.10.1)
    pip install pygdal==`gdal-config --version`

    # if you cannot find exactly the same version, be sure to install at least the closer major one e.g. 2.1.2 -> 2.1.2.3
    
You can now setup and start GeoNode::

    # Paver setup
    paver setup
    paver sync
    paver start

In case you want to be involved in static files development::

    sudo apt-get install npm
    sudo npm install
    sudo npm install -g bower
    sudo npm install -g grunt

Rebuild libraries through::

    cd geonode/static
    bower cache clean
    bower update
    grunt production

On a production environment, remember to refresh also the "static_root" folder::

    python manage.py collectstatic --clear -i site-packages* -i .components* -i node_modules* --noinput

Windows, OSX and others
=======================


Windows
-------

It is now available an automatic installer for Windows systems which configures GeoNode with PostgreSQL DB and few sample layers on a few steps.
See detailed instructions and steps of the GeoNode Windows Installer at section :ref:`win_binary_installer`.

If you have different needs or just want to configure the GeoNode environment manually, please continue reading the guide below.

To install in Windows it is assumed you're familiar with python development and virtualenv on Windows and that you're familiar with the windows command prompt. You will need the follow prerequisites installed:

    * Java JDK
    * Python 2.7.9
      * Earlier versions of python require you to install distutils (easy_install) - http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#setuptools
    * ant (bin directory must be on system PATH)
    * maven2 (bin directory must be on system PATH)
    * git

Install and configure from the windows command prompt, if you don't already have python virtualenv installed, then do it now::

   easy_install virtualenv

Create virtualenv and activate it::

    cd <Directory to install the virtualenv & geonode into>
    virtualenv <name of virtualenv folder>
    virtualenv <name of virtualenv folder>\scripts\activate

Clone GeoNode::

    git clone https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode.git

    cd geonode

Install Python native dependencies, this command will look for and install binary distributions (pip install will attempt to build and fail)::

    pip install paver
    paver win_install_deps



Install GeoNode in the local virtualenv::

    pip install -e .

You have two options to set up the GEOS and GDAL libraries.  Either create an environment variable
or add the variables to your local_settings.py file as below.

    GEOS_LIBRARY_PATH="C:/path/to/geos_c.dll"
    GDAL_LIBRARY_PATH="C:/path/to/gdal111.dll"

The GEOS and GDAL libraries can be found in your <virtualenv directory>\Lib\site-packages\GDAL-1.11.0-py2.7-win32.egg\osgeo\ folder.


Setup GeoServer::

    paver setup

Start the servers.  You have the option to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable or use the --java_path.::

    paver start --java_path="C:\path\to\java\java.exe"

or if you set your JAVA_HOME environment variables (e.g. JAVA_HOME="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_75\")::

    paver start

Once the package is installed, please consult :ref:`custom_install` to learn how to create an account for the admin user and tweak the settings to get more performance.

OSX
---

The recommended install method in these platforms is to use a virtualization solution, like `Virtual Box`_, install the latest `Ubuntu Linux`_ and then proceed with the steps mentioned above. Some GeoNode developers prefer to use `Vagrant`_ - a VirtualBox wrapper, the steps for this are detailed below. The Vagrant quickstart guide shows how to get a Linux VM configured in most operating systems. However, if you would like to develop natively on Mac OS X please follow the following instructions.

You may need brew install various dependencies::

    mkdir -p ~/pyenv
    virtualenv ~/pyenv/geonode
    source ~/pyenv/geonode/bin/activate
    git clone https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode
    cd geonode
    pip install lxml
    pip install pyproj
    pip install nose
    pip install httplib2
    pip install shapely
    pip install pillow
    pip install paver

Node and tools required for static files development::

    brew install node
    npm install -g bower
    npm install -g grunt-cli


Rebuild libraries through::

    cd geonode/static
    bower cache clean
    bower update
    grunt production

On a production environment, remember to refresh also the "static_root" folder::

    python manage.py collectstatic --clear -i site-packages* -i .components* -i node_modules* --noinput

Install pip dependencies::

    pip install -e .

Paver handles dependencies for Geonode, first setup (this will download and update your python dependencies - ensure you're in a virtualenv)::

    paver setup
    paver start

Optional: To generate document thumbnails for PDFs and other ghostscript file types, download ghostscript: https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/9980/gpl-ghostscript::

    sudo apt-get install imagemagick
    brew install imagemagick
    pip install Wand==0.3.5

Once fully started, you should see a message indicating the address of your geonode.
The default username and password are ``admin`` and ``admin``::

  Development GeoNode is running at http://localhost:8000/
  The GeoNode is an unstoppable machine
  Press CTRL-C to shut down

Before starting GeoNode (paver start), you could test your installation by running tests::

    paver test
    paver test_integration

In case you want to build yourself the documentation, you need to install Sphinx and the run 'make html' from within the docs directory::

    pip install Sphinx
    cd docs
    make html

You can eventually generate a pdf containing the whole documentation set. For this purpose, if using Ubuntu 12.4 you will need to install the texlive-full package::

    sudo apt-get install texlive-full
    make latexpdf

.. note::

  When running ``virtualenv venv`` the ``--system-site-packages`` option is
  not required.  If not enabled, the bootstrap script will sandbox your virtual
  environment from any packages that are installed in the system, useful if
  you have incompatible versions of libraries such as Django installed
  system-wide.  On the other hand, most of the times it is useful to use a version of
  the Python Imaging Library provided by your operating system
  vendor, or packaged other than on PyPI.  When in doubt, however, just leave
  this option out.
