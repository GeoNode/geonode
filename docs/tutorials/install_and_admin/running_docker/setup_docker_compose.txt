=============================================
Orchestrate GeoNode stack with Docker Compose
=============================================

`Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`_ is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications automatically.
This tool relies on **Docker** daemon so make sure you have completed successfully the section on :ref:`_setup_docker`.

Introducing main concepts
=========================

In a composed application, different pieces of the application are called **services**. A service runs just one image but it specifies how that image is executed, what ports have to be used, which containers are depending each other, which volumes and so on.

A **stack** is a group of interrelated services that share dependencies, and can be orchestrated and scaled together. A single stack is capable of defining and coordinating the functionality of an entire application like GeoNode.

Install Docker Compose on Ubuntu
================================

Download the latest version of ``docker-compose`` binary::

    sudo curl -L \
    https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.19.0/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` \
    -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Adjust executable permissions to the binary::

    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Verify the installation::

    docker-compose --version

Running GeoNode stack
=====================

Clone the repository::

    git clone https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode.git

Launch the stack with the build of GeoNode so any changes you did will be immediately available::

    docker-compose up --build
	
.. note:: 
   **For Windows users**: In case you're using the native Docker for Windows (on Hyper-V) you will probably be affected by an error related to mounting the /var/run/docker.sock volume. It's due to a `problem with the current version of Docker Compose <https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/1829>`_ for Windows.
   In this case you need to set the **COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS** environmental variable:
   
   .. code-block:: none
   
      set COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS=1 
   
   before running docker-compose up

GeoNode will be available at the ip address of the ``docker0`` interface::

    ifconfig -a
