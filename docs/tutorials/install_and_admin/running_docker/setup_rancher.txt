===============================
Scaling and deploy with Rancher
===============================

`Rancher <http://rancher.com/>`_ is an open source software platform that enables organizations to run and manage Docker and Kubernetes in production.

.. figure:: img/rancher_overview.png

With Rancher, organizations no longer have to build a container services platform from scratch using a distinct set of open source technologies.
Rancher supplies the entire software stack needed to manage containers in production.

Introducing main concepts
=========================

Rancher takes in raw computing resources from any public or private cloud in the form of Linux hosts. Each Linux host can be a virtual machine or physical machine.

Rancher includes a distribution of all popular container orchestration and scheduling frameworks today, including **Docker Swarm**, **Kubernetes**, and **Mesos**.

Rancher users can deploy an entire multi-container clustered application from the application catalog or docker compose files with few clicks.

Getting started with Rancher
============================

Install Rancher
---------------

To install the latest stable version run the following docker command::

    docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped -p 8080:8080 rancher/server:stable

Setup Rancher
-------------

Verify that Rancher server is running on the port defined above (default is ``8080``)::

    docker ps -a

After opening the browser at that port:

    .. figure:: img/rancher_home.png

then the instance can be secured navigating the url `Local authentication <http://rancher-server-ip:8080/admin/access/local>`_ :

    .. figure:: img/rancher_auth.png

Choose a ``username`` and a ``passord`` and then enable the access control by clicking the button at the bottom.

Add new host to the infrastructure
----------------------------------

From the **Default** menu follow the link `add host <http://rancher-server-ip:8080/env/1a5/infra/hosts/add>`_ :

    .. figure:: img/rancher_url.png

and click the button **Save** to confirm. The administrator will be landed to the following page:

    .. figure:: img/rancher_host.png

Several options will be shown to decide what kind of machine driver is going to be used. For a local bare metal or virtual machine choose the **Custom** option. After that follow the indicated steps to prepare the new host

    1. Start up a Linux machine somewhere and install a `supported version <http://docs.rancher.com/rancher/v1.6/en/hosts/#supported-docker-versions>`_ of Docker on it. Refer to the section on :ref:`_setup_docker`.
    2. Allow IPsec networking between hosts on `UDP` ports `500` and `4500`.
    3. Add labels to be applied to the host. This is optional but it is required for GeoNode if you want all the containers of a stack deployed on a same host. In that case add for example `Key:geonodehost` and `Value:<host label value>` which will be translated to the label `geonodehost=<host label value>`.
    4. Specify the public IP `<host-server-public-ip>` that should be registered for the host. This is particularly import if the machine is behind a firewall/NAT.
    5. Copy, paste, and run the command below to register the host with Rancher. The value of `registrationToken` is provided by the system. 

        sudo docker run -e CATTLE_AGENT_IP="<host-server-public-ip>"  -e CATTLE_HOST_LABELS='geonodehost=<host label value>'  --rm --privileged -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /var/lib/rancher:/var/lib/rancher rancher/agent:v1.2.9 http://<rancher-server-ip>:8080/v1/scripts/<registrationToken>
        # sudo can be avoided if the user has been privileged
    
    6. Click on the **Close** button.

After some minutes the new host should be registered and available in the active status under the menu **Infrastructure** => **Hosts**.

Since Rancher itself has containerized services, some of them which are managing the new host have to be available under the menu **Stacks** => **All**.

Deploy GeoNode as stack on Rancher
==================================

Create a stack from a docker-compose file
-----------------------------------------

This is the first option to deploy GeoNode stack from a template like :download:`this docker compose file <resources/docker-compose.yml>`.

Before going to create a new stack by loading it from the Rancher console the values of the placeholders `<host label value>` and `<host-server-public-ip>` have to be edited accordingly to your previous setup.

Once the `docker-compose.yml` is ready follow the menu **Stacks** => **User**:

    .. figure:: img/rancher_add_stack.png

Then click the **Add Stack** button:

    .. figure:: img/rancher_new_stack.png

From the property **docker-compose.yml** load the file previously edited, then click the **Create** button:

.. warning:: The first time the host has to provision all the images and can take a while

At the end of the provisioning job all the GeoNode services will be active and the stack available as deployed application:

    .. figure:: img/rancher_geonode_stack.png

GeoNode is now available at the public ip address defined into the `GEONODE_LB_HOST_IP` variable of your docker-compose file.

As usual the default credentials for the master administrator is `admin/admin`.
