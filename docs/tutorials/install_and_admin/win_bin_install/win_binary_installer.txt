#. An instance of Python 2.7.10 32bit with GDAL 1.11 extensions

#. PostgreSQL 8.4 with PostGIS 1.5.4 spatial extensions

#. Apache Tomcat 7.0.39 with GeoServer for GeoNode webapp

#. Apache HTTPD Server 2.49

The source code of the installer, along with all the components needed to build a custom executable and instructions, can be found at https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode-win-installer

.. warning:: In order to install GeoNode using the binary installer, you will need Windows Administrator rights.

Step by step GeoNode Windows installation
=========================================

1. Execute the binary `file <http://build.geonode.org/windows/>`_ downloaded from GeoNode servers

4. Read and accept the licence agreement on the next screen

5. Choose the install location. This is the folder wher all the pieces of the GeoNode environment will be placed. You can also keep the default one.

   .. note:: It is highly recommended to avoid long names with spaces and strange character. Also avoid positions which are system protected. Even if the installer runs with Administrator rights, you may encounter issues customizing GeoNode in the future.

   .. warning:: Before proceeding, please be sure you don't have other JRE 1.7 32bit installation already present on your system. In order to do that please follow the instructions below:
   
   Go to the "Control Panel"
  
     .. figure:: img/win_install_08.jpg
  
   Click on "Unistall a Program"
  
     .. figure:: img/win_install_09.jpg
    
   Check that the menu does not contain entries similar to the one shown in the following figure

8. Choose the location of the external GeoServer Data dir (where the physical geospatial files will be placed). It is recommended to keep the default value.

   .. figure:: img/win_install_11.jpg
   
9. Select the minimum and maximum values for the memory to assign to the GeoServer JVM. This depends mainly from the RAM avaialble on the target PC. The default values should work on most cases. Increase the Maximum Heap Memory if possible.
