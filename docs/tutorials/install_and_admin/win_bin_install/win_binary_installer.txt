Window Binary Installer
=======================

The GeoNode Windows Binary installer can be downloaded `here <http://build.geonode.org/windows/>`_.

The Windows binary installer is an executable file which automatically sets up your system for GeoNode. It will install everything on the target folder, chosen by the user as a first step.

In particular the installer configures the following components:

#. An instance of the Oracle JRE 1.7 32bits

#. An instance of Python 2.7.10 32bit with GDAL 1.11 extensions

#. PostgreSQL 8.4 with PostGIS 1.5.4 spatial extensions

#. Apache Tomcat 7.0.39 with GeoServer for GeoNode webapp

#. Apache HTTPD Server 2.49

The source code of the installer, along with all the components needed to build a custom executable and instructions, can be found at https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode-win-installer

.. warning:: In order to install GeoNode using the binary installer, you will need Windows Administrator rights.

Step by step GeoNode Windows installation
=========================================

1. Execute the binary `file <http://build.geonode.org/windows/>`_ downloaded from GeoNode servers 

   .. figure:: img/win_install_01.jpg

2. The first time you could get a Windows warning about the unknown publisher. Click on "Run Anyway" button in order to proceed

   .. figure:: img/win_install_02.jpg

3. Click "Next" at the welcome screen

   .. figure:: img/win_install_03.jpg

4. Read and accept the licence agreement on the next screen

   .. figure:: img/win_install_04.jpg

5. Choose the install location. This is the folder where all the pieces of the GeoNode environment will be placed. You can also keep the default one.

   .. note:: It is highly recommended to avoid long names with spaces and strange character. Also avoid positions which are system protected. Even if the installer runs with Administrator rights, you may encounter issues customizing GeoNode in the future.

6. Choose the name of the Start Menu folder. This is the name of the folder which will be created into the "Windows App Toolbar". You can also keep the default one.

   .. figure:: img/win_install_06.jpg

7. Next step will install the JEW 1.7 32bit version on the installation folder.

   .. figure:: img/win_install_07.jpg

   .. warning:: Before proceeding, please be sure you don't have other JRE 1.7 32bit installation already present on your system. In order to do that please follow the instructions below:
   
   Go to the "Control Panel"
  
     .. figure:: img/win_install_08.jpg
  
   Click on "Unistall a Program"
  
     .. figure:: img/win_install_09.jpg
    
   Check that the menu does not contain entries similar to the one shown in the following figure
  
     .. figure:: img/win_install_10.jpg
        
8. Choose the location of the external GeoServer Data directory (where the physical geospatial files will be placed). It is recommended to keep the default value.

   .. figure:: img/win_install_11.jpg
   
9. Select the minimum and maximum values for the memory to assign to the GeoServer JVM. This depends mainly from the RAM available on the target PC. The default values should work on most cases. Increase the Maximum Heap Memory if possible.

   .. figure:: img/win_install_12.jpg

10. Choose the user and password for the GeoServer Administrator **outside** GeoNode authentication. The form presents the default ones.

   .. figure:: img/win_install_13.jpg
   
11. Choose the TCP/IP port to run Apache Tomcat. The default value (8080) is widely used from a lot of installation. If your system is not fully clean, it is kindly suggested to choose another value between 1024 and 65535.

   .. figure:: img/win_install_14.jpg
   
12. Proceed with the installation of Python 2.7.10 32bit.

   .. figure:: img/win_install_15.jpg
   
   This will be placed into the target GeoNode installation folder along with GDAL 1.11 extensions
   
      .. figure:: img/win_install_16.jpg

13. Proceed with the installation of PostgreSQL 8.4.22 and PostGIS 1.5.4.

   .. note:: The installation proceeds silently and using the default values:
   
      - PostgreSQL: TCP/IP Port 5454
      
      - User/password: postgres/g30Nod3-P0stgr3s

14. Ready to install. The page summarizes the user choices and asks to finish the installation process.

   .. figure:: img/win_install_21.jpg

15. Click "Next" and proceed with the installation and automatic configuration of Apache Tomcat 7.0.65535

   .. figure:: img/win_install_22.jpg

16. Confirm "Yes" in order to complete the GeoNode installation and configuration process.

   .. figure:: img/win_install_23.jpg

17. Wait until the process finishes copying the files

   .. figure:: img/win_install_24.jpg

18. At a certain point the process configures the database

   .. figure:: img/win_install_25.jpg

   and asks to copy the GeoNode static resources.
   
   .. figure:: img/win_install_26.jpg

   .. warning:: Enter "yes" and click "Enter". The system will wait the user input!
   
   .. figure:: img/win_install_27.jpg

19. As a final step, the process automatically creates 8 sample layers on GeoNode

   .. figure:: img/win_install_28.jpg

20. You need to "Reboot" the system in order to make everything working fine

   .. figure:: img/win_install_29.jpg

21. Once the reboot has done, if everything has worked, you should be able to access the GeoNode Home directory on your local computer directly from the Windows App Toolbar
