Running a VM with Vagrant
=========================

In this section you will find instructions on how to setup an Ubuntu 14.04 VM using
`Vagrant`_

.. _Vagrant: https://www.vagrantup.com/

Vagrant Setup
=============

Download Vagrant from the `official <https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads>`_ web site.
Choose the installer matching your operating system and architecture.

Installation process is straightforward, refer to Vagrant `official documentation
<https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html>`_ if you encounter any problem.

At the end of the installation process log out your system and log back
in.

Vagrant is going to need a `provider <https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/providers/>`_
in order to setup the Virtual Machines. `VirtualBox` is supported out of the box.
Just make sure you install `one of the supported versions of VirtualBox <https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/virtualbox>`_

Open a terminal and type `vagrant version`. A message containing the installed
version of Vagrant will be printed on the terminal
::

    Installed Version: 1.7.2
    Latest Version: 1.7.4
    ...

Virtual Machine Setup
=====================

Now that Vagrant is installed let's create our Ubuntu Virtual Machine. Open the terminal
and create a new folder called `vagrand`. enter the folder and run
::

    vagrant init ubuntu/trusty32

    A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
    ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
    the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
    `vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.


This will create a configuration file called `Vagrantfile` containing the settings
for the virtual machine, notably the `config.vm.box` variable set to "ubuntu/trusty32"
will tell Vagrant the specific VM we want to run (Ubuntu 14.04 "Trusty Tahr", 32 bit version)

To start the VM, run
::

    vagrant up

The first time you run the command it is going to take some since you do not have a
locally available image of the VM. Vagrant will download the VM from the `Vagrant
Could <https://vagrantcloud.com/>`_ to your local system.

At the end of the download process Vagrant will start the VM.

To access the Virtual machine, run
::

    vagrant ssh

.. note::

    You need an SSH client for the previous command to work. Most Linux distributions
    come with an SSH installed. If you are using Windows as the guest operating system
    install MinGW or Cygwin or Git to obtain a command line SSH client. More information
    available `here <http://docs-v1.vagrantup.com/v1/docs/getting-started/ssh.html>`_

You will be connected to the guest Virtual Machine over SSH as user `vagrant`.
