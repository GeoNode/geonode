CentOS Setup
============

We are re going to install a minimal CentOS 7 distribution.
You can get a copy of the .iso the image used for the installation
`here <http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1611.iso>`_.

Boot up the installation DVD and start the `CentOS 7` Installation wizard.

    - Under `Select Date & Time` an set appropriate Date and Time settings
    - Under `Keyboard` and choose the keyboard layout
    - Under `Installation Destination` select the hard disk where CentOS will
      be installed.

      Create a custom partitioning scheme as follows:

      +-----------------+----------------+-----------+-------------+
      | Partition Label | Partition Type | Size      | Mount Point |
      +=================+================+===========+=============+
      | boot            | ext3           |   700 MB  | /boot       |
      +-----------------+----------------+-----------+-------------+
      | root            | ext4           |    35 GB  | /           |
      +-----------------+----------------+-----------+-------------+
      | swap            | swap           |     4 GB  |             |
      +-----------------+----------------+-----------+-------------+
    - Under `Networking` configure your network interface according to your infrastructure
      you can either set it to `DHCP` to automatically get all the settings from
      a local DHCP server or configure it by hand.
    - Enable the network interface, then go back to `Select Date & Time` and enable
      NTP synchronization periodically get date and time settings from CentOS servers
    - Click on `Begin Installation`
    - Now set the password for the `root` user. Also click on `User Creation` to
      create the `geo` user.
    -  Wait for the installation process to finish, then reboot your machine


Network configuration
=====================

The network configuration should already be set, since it was set during CentOS
setup stage.

You may want to review the configuration files ::

   /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-DEVICE

You may also want to review the file ``/etc/resolv.conf``
to check the name servers.

Check that the connection is up by pinging and external server::

   ping 8.8.8.8

Check that the DNS are properly configuring by pinging a host by its name::

   ping google.com

.. warning::

   Please note that in CentOS only ssh incoming connections are allowed;
   all other incoming connections are disabled by default.

   In the paragraph related to the httpd service you can find details about
   how to enable incoming traffic.

Note that after configuring the network, you may continue installing the system setup using a ssh connection.

User access configuration
=========================

Login as ``root'` user and give the ``geo`` user administrative privileges
by adding him to the ``wheel`` group: ::

   usermod -aG wheel geo

SSH access
----------

Allow SSH connections through the firewall
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

On CentOS 7 the firewall is enabled by default. To allow SSH clients to connect
to the machine allow incoming connections on port 22::

    firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=22/tcp --permanent
    firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=ssh --permanent
    firewall-cmd --reload

Disable SSH login for the `root` user
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
.. warning::

    Before you disable root login make sure you are able to login via SSH with
    `geo` user account and you have the privileges to run `sudo su` to
    switch to the `root` user account.

Edit file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to disable `root` login via SSH::

    PermitRootLogin no

Public key authentication
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

`Public key authentication`_ is generally considered a safer way to authenticate
users for SSH access. Let's set it up and disable password based authentication

.. _a link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography

First generate a public/private key pair using `ssh-keygen`::

    ssh-keygen

Follow the procedure, you will end up with your newly generated key under ``~/.ssh``
Now copy your `public` (by default it is called id_rsa.pub) key over the CentOS
machine in ``/home/geo/.ssh/authorized_keys``. There are several ways to do
it, we are going to use the `ssh-copy-id` tool::

        ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub geo@<server-ip-address>

You should now be able to login via SSH as `geo` without been asked for
the password::


    ssh geo@<server-ip-address>

You can now disable password based login over SSH

.. warning::
    Before disabling password authentication make sure you've installed your
    public key on the server and you are able to login without password

Edit ``/etc/ssh/sshd_config`` as follows::

    ...
    RSAAuthentication yes
    ...
    PubkeyAuthentication yes
    ...
    PasswordAuthentication no
    ...
    UsePAM no
    ...


Installing ntp
==============

Install the program for NTP server synchronization::

   sudo yum install ntp

Edit ``/etc/ntp.conf`` and add the following line before the first ``server`` directive::

   server tempo.ien.it     # Galileo Ferraris

Replace ``tempo.ien.it`` with your nearest NTP server.

Sync with the server by issuing::

   systemctl start ntpd

Set the time synchronization as an automatically started daemon::

   systemctl enable ntpd

Installing base packages
========================

Install common utility packages::

    sudo yum install -y man vim openssh-clients zip unzip wget

Update the system with EPEL latest release::

    sudo yum install -y epel-release
    sudo yum update -y && sudo reboot

Install pip and necessary dependencies::

    sudo yum install -y python-devel python-setuptools python-pip python-virtualenv
    sudo pip install --upgrade pip
