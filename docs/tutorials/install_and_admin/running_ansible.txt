Running Ansible scripts
=======================

`Ansible <https://www.ansible.com/>`_ is a free software platform used for configuring
and managing computers. It is written in `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ and
allows users to manage `nodes` (computers) over SSH.

Configuration files are written in `YAML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>`_,
a simple, human-readable, data serialization format.

Installing Ansible
==================

Before you install `Ansible` make sure you have Python 2.6 or Python 2.7 on the
controlling machine, you will also need an SSH client. Most Linux distributions
come with an SSH client preinstalled.

If you encounter any problems during the installation, refer to the
`official documentation <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html>`_.

Windows
-------

Windows is not supported as a controlling machine.

Ubuntu
------

Fist configure Ansible `PPA <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Package_Archive>`_::

    sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
    sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible

Then update your available software index and install Ansible::

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install ansible

Running Ansible
===============

To test your Ansible installation, run the following command

.. note::

    you need a running SSH server on your machine for this to work::

        ansible localhost -m ping

You should get the following output::

        localhost | success >> {
        "changed": false,
        "ping": "pong"
    }

Ansible Hosts file
==================

Ansible keeps information about the managed nodes in the `inventory` or `hosts file`.
Edit or create the hosts file::

    vim /etc/ansible/hosts

This file contains a list of nodes for Ansible to manage. Nodes can be referred
either with IP or host name. The syntax is the following::

    192.168.1.50
    aserver.example.org
    bserver.example.org

You can also arrange hosts in groups::

    mail.example.com

    [webservers]
    foo.example.com
    bar.example.com

    [dbservers]
    one.example.com
    two.example.com
    three.example.com

Public Key access
=================

To avoid having to type your user's password to connect to the nodes over and over, using
SSH keys is recommended.

To setup Public Key SSH access to the nodes. First create a key pair::

    ssh-keygen

And follow the instructions on the screen. A new key pair will be generated and
placed inside the `.ssh` folder in your user's home directory.

All you need to do now is copy the public key (id_rsa.pub) into the `authorized_keys`
file on the node you want to manage, inside the user's home directory. For example
if you want to be able to connect to training.geonode1.com as user `geo` edit the
/home/geo/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the remote machine and add the content
of your public key inside the file.

For more information on how to setup SSH keys in Ubuntu
refer to `this <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys>`_ document.

Connect to managed nodes
========================

Now that SSH access to the managed nodes is in place for all the nodes inside the Ansible
`inventory` (hosts file), we can run our first command::

    ansible all -m ping -u geo

.. note::

        change `geo` with the username to use for SSH login

The output will be similar to this:::

    ansible all -m ping -u geo
    84.33.2.70 | success >> {
        "changed": false,
        "ping": "pong"
    }

We asked Ansible to connect to all the machine in our `Inventory` as user `geo`
and run the `module` ping (modules are Ansible's units of work, more on that later...).
As you can see by the output, Ansible successfully connected to the remote machine
and executed the module `ping`.

Ad hoc commands
===============

An ad-hoc command is something that you might type in to do something really quick,
but don’t want to save for later.

Later you are going to write so called `Playbooks` with the commands to run on
the controlled node but for learning purposes ad-hoc commands can be used to do
quick things.

One example of an ad-hoc command is the ping command we just ran. We typed in the
command line and ran it interactively.

Another example::

    ansible all -m shell -a "free" -u geo
    84.33.2.70 | success | rc=0 >>
                 total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
    Mem:       4049236    3915596     133640          0     650560    2487416
    -/+ buffers/cache:     777620    3271616
    Swap:      4194300     730268    3464032

In this example we ran the `free` command on the remote hosts to get memory usage
stats. Note that we used the `shell` module (-m flag) with the command as the argument
(-a flag).

File Transfer
=============

Another use case for the Ansible command is to transfer files over SCP::

    ansible 84.33.2.70 -m copy -a "src=/home/geo/test dest=~/" -u geo
    84.33.2.70 | success >> {
        "changed": true,
        "dest": "/home/geo/test",
        "gid": 1000,
        "group": "geo",
        "md5sum": "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e",
        "mode": "0664",
        "owner": "geo",
        "size": 0,
        "src": "/home/geo/.ansible/tmp/ansible-tmp-1444051174.15-189094870931130/source",
        "state": "file",
        "uid": 1000

We used the `ansible` command to transfer the local file /home/geo/test to the remote
node in user's home directory ('~/').

Managing Packages
=================

Another use case is installing or upgrading packages on the remote nodes. You can use
the `apt` module to achieve this on Debian based systems or the `yum` module on
Red Hat based systems::

    ansible 84.33.2.70 -m apt -a "name=apache2 state=present"

For example the previous command will install the Apache web server on the remote system
(if not present).

You can use the same module to make sure a package is at the latest version::

    ansible 84.33.2.70 -m apt -a "name=apache2 state=latest"

Managing Services
=================

Use the `service` module to ensure a given service is started on all web servers::

    ansible webservers -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"

(where `webserver` is a group defined in Ansible Inventory)

Restart the service::

    ansible webservers -m service -a "name=httpd state=restarted"

Or stop it::

    ansible webservers -m service -a "name=httpd state=stopped"

For more information on ad-hoc command refer to the `official documentation <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_adhoc.html>`_.

These were just a few of the modules available for Ansible. See the
`complete list <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/list_of_all_modules.html>`_ available
at the Ansible web site.

Ansible Playbooks
=================

Playbooks are Ansible’s configuration, deployment and orchestration language.

Playbooks are a completely different way to use Ansible than in ad-hoc task execution
mode, and are particularly powerful.

Playbooks can declare configurations, but they can also orchestrate steps of any
manual ordered process.

While you might run the main /usr/bin/ansible program for ad-hoc tasks, playbooks
are more likely to be kept in source control and used to push out your configuration
or assure the configurations of your remote systems are in spec.

Playbooks language example
---------------------------

Playbooks are expressed in `YAML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>`_ format

Here is an example of a Playbook::

    ---
    - hosts: webservers
      vars:
        http_port: 80
        max_clients: 200
      remote_user: root
      tasks:
      - name: ensure apache is at the latest version
        yum: pkg=httpd state=latest
      - name: write the apache config file
        template: src=/srv/httpd.j2 dest=/etc/httpd.conf
        notify:
        - restart apache
      - name: ensure apache is running (and enable it at boot)
        service: name=httpd state=started enabled=yes
      handlers:
        - name: restart apache
          service: name=httpd state=restarted

Every Playbook begins with three dashes at the very top of the file to indicate
that this is a YAML file.

This example Playbook contains only one Play. The play is composed of three parts:

    - hosts
    - tasks
    - handlers

The hosts part specifies to which hosts in the Inventory this playbook applies and
how to connect to them.

The tasks part describes the desired state or actions to perform on the hosts.

The handlers part describes the handlers for this playbook (more on handlers later).

In the example above there are three tasks. Each task has a name, a module and zero
or more arguments for the module.

The first task specifies that we want the latest version of Apache installed on
the system. This is accomplished by the `yum` module.

The second task specifies a configuration file for Apache using a `template`.
Template files are written in `Jinja2 template language <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`_.

The third task make sure the Apache web server is running using the `service` module.

When you run a Playbook using the ansible-playbook command, Ansible will connect to
the hosts specified in the hosts section and run the tasks one by one, in order.

One or more tasks may have a `notify` section (just like the second task in our example).
The `notify` actions are triggered at the end of each block of tasks in a playbook,
and will only be triggered once even if notified by multiple different tasks.
When triggered, the corresponding handler will be executed.
In the example above the handler will restart Apache because we changed a config
file.

Run a Playbook
--------------

Now that we have created a sample Playbook, save it on the file system and execute it::

    ansible-playbook test.yml -u geo

    PLAY [84.33.2.70] *************************************************************

    GATHERING FACTS ***************************************************************
    ok: [84.33.2.70]

    TASK: [test] ******************************************************************
    ok: [84.33.2.70]

    PLAY RECAP ********************************************************************
    84.33.2.70                 : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0
