=============

Let's download GeoNode from the main GeoNode repository on GitHub:

.. 
    For the purpose of this training the GeoNode repository has
    been downloaded and placed in the `geonode` user `home folder` (/home/geo/geonode).
    *Skip* the following command group.

::

    git clone https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode.git
    sudo useradd -m geonode
    sudo mv ~/geonode /home/geonode/


Move into the project folder
::

    cd /home/geonode/geonode

And install GeoNode

.. note::
    For the purpose of this training GeoNode python packages has
    been downloaded and installed, *Skip* the following command:

::

    sudo pip install -e .

The following command will download a GeoServer web archive
that we are going to use in GeoServer setup:

.. note::
    Again, for the purpose of this training the GeoServer web archive has been
    downloaded.
    *Skip* the following command.

::

        sudo paver setup

In the next section we are going to setup PostgreSQL Databases for GeoNode
