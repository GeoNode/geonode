Setup Using Ansible
===================

Using `Ansible <http://www.ansible.com/>`_ we can automate the installation and
configuration of GeoNode on local or remote machines. If you never used Ansible
before take a look at the `Running Ansible scripts` section of the documentation
or `Ansible official documentation <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/index.html>`_.

GeoNode setup with Ansible
==========================

The Virtual Machines we provided for the training come with Ansible preinstalled.
In the `geo` user home folder ( /home/geo/ ) you will find a simple Ansible playbook
we wrote for demonstration along with some resource files used by the playbook itself.

To start the installation with Ansible open a terminal and navigate to the `ansible`
folder inside geo's home folder::

    cd /home/geo/ansible

Then run the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command::

    ansible-playbook playbook.yml

Ansible will run through the instructions in the playbook and setup GeoNode on your
local machine.

Ansible will print information about each step executed. The whole setup is going
to take a few minutes.

At the end of the execution of the playbook all you need to do is set GeoNode
administrator's password::

    cd /home/geonode/geonode
    python manage.py changepassword sysadmin
