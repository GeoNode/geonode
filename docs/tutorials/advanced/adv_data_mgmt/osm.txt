Loading OSM Data into GeoNode
=============================

In this section, we will walk through the steps necessary to load OSM data into your GeoNode project. As discussed in previous sections, your GeoNode already uses OSM tiles from MapQuest and the main OSM servers as some of the available base layers. This session is specifically about extracting actual data from OSM and converting it for use in your project and potentially for Geoprocessing tasks.

The first step in this process is to get the data from OSM. We will be using the OSM Overpass API since it lets us do more complex queries than the OSM API itself. You should refer to the OSM Overpass API documentation to learn about all of its features. It is an extremely powerful API that lets you extract data from OSM using a very sophisticated API.

- http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API
- http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Language_Guide

In this example, we will be extracting building footprint data around Port au Prince in Haiti. To do this we will use an interactive tool that makes it easy construct a Query against the Overpass API. Point your browser at http://overpass-turbo.eu/ and use the search tools to zoom into Port Au Prince and Cité Soleil specifically.

You will need to cut and paste the query specified below to get all of the appropriate data under the bounding box::

    <osm-script>
      <union into="_">
        <bbox-query {{bbox}}/>
        <recurse into="x" type="node-relation"/>
        <query type="way">
          <bbox-query {{bbox}}/>
          <has-kv k="building" v="yes"></has-kv>
        </query>
        <recurse into="x" type="way-node"/>
        <recurse type="way-relation"/>
      </union>
      <print mode="meta"/>
    </osm-script>

This should look like the following.

When you have the bounding box and query set correctly, click the "Export" button on the menu to bring up the export menu, and then click the API interpreter link to download the OSM data base on the query you have specified.

.. figure:: img/overpass_export.png

This will download a file named 'export.osm' on your file system. You will probably want to rename it something else more specific. You can do that by issuing the following command in the directory where it was downloaded::

    $ mv export.osm cite_soleil_buildings.osm

.. note:: You can also rename the file in your Operating Systems File management tool (Windows Explorer, Finder etc).

Exporting OSM data to shapefile using QGIS
------------------------------------------

Now that we have OSM data on our filesystem, we will need to convert it into a format suitable for uploading into your GeoNode. There are many ways to accomplish this, but for purposes of this example, we will use an OSM QGIS plugin that makes if fairly easy. Please consult the wiki page that explains how to install this plugin and make sure it is installed in your QGIS instance. Once its installed, you can use the Web Menu to load your file.

.. figure:: img/load_osm.png

This will bring up a dialog box that you can use to find and convert the OSM file we downloaded.

.. figure:: img/load_osm_dialog.png

When the process has completed,  you will see your layers in the Layer Tree in QGIS.

.. figure:: img/qgis_layers.png

Since we are only interested in the polygons, we can turn the other 2 layers off in the Layer Tree.

.. figure:: img/qgis_layer_off.png

The next step is to use QGIS to convert this layer into a Shapefile so we can upload it into GeoNode. To do this, select the layer in the Layer tree, right click and then select the Save As option.

.. figure:: img/qgis_save_as.png

This will bring up the Save Vector Layer as Dialog.

.. figure:: img/qgis_save_as_dialog.png

Specify where on disk you want your file saved, and hit Save then OK.

.. figure:: img/save_layer_path.png

You now have a shapefile of the data you extracted from OSM that you can use to load into GeoNode. Use the GeoNode Layer Upload form to load the Shapefile parts into your GeoNode, and optionally edit the metadata and then you can view your layer in the Layer Info page in your geonode.

.. figure:: img/buildings_layer_geonode.png

.. note:: You may want to switch to an imagery layer in order to more easily see the buildings on the OSM background.

Exporting OSM data to shapefile using GDAL
------------------------------------------

An alternative way to export the .osm file to a shapefile is to use `ogr2ogr <http://www.gdal.org/ogr2ogr.html>`_ combined with the `GDAL osm driver <http://www.gdal.org/drv_osm.html>`_, available from GDAL version 1.10.

As a first step, inspect how the GDAL OSM driver sees the .osm file using the ogrinfo command::

    $ ogrinfo cite_soleil_buildings.osm
    Had to open data source read-only.
    INFO: Open of `cite_soleil_buildings.osm'
          using driver `OSM' successful.
    1: points (Point)
    2: lines (Line String)
    3: multilinestrings (Multi Line String)
    4: multipolygons (Multi Polygon)
    5: other_relations (Geometry Collection)

ogrinfo has detected 5 different geometric layers inside the OSM data source. As we are just interested in the buildings, you will just export the multipolygons layer to a new shapefile using the GDAL ogr2ogr command utility::

    $ ogr2ogr cite_soleil_buildings cite_soleil_buildings.osm multipolygons

Now you can upload the shapefile to GeoNode using the GeoNode Upload form in the same manner as you did in the previous section.

Using the osm-extract script to download OSM Data into PostGIS
--------------------------------------------------------------

osm-extract is a script that allows to download data from OpenStreetMap, perform ETL procedures in order to classify data into layers and publish it in a PostgreSQL+PostGIS database.
It is based on a fork from Terronodo and it is built around a Makefile with instructions that must be executed with the Linux make command (we assume you are working on a Linux based OS).
Once OSM data have been loaded into PostGIS, they can be published in GeoNode.

The script processes the whole .pbf file provided in input, therefore the processing extent depends on the bounding box of the .pbf file itself.
In addition data can be updated on a fixed frequency, by executing the Makefile with a scheduled cron job. In such case a sql instruction can be executed in order to update the publication date of the respective metadata published by GeoNode.

Steps for putting it in production
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
#. Download the repo
#. Install the dependencies: osmosis. (GeoNode  is assumed to be up and running)
#. Launch the Makefile for the first time
#. Publish the layers in GeoNode, update_layers
#. Customize the sh file
#. Customize the SQL file
#. Schedule the shell file as a cron job

**1. Download the repo**::

  git clone https://github.com/MalawiGeospatialTools/osm-extract.git

**2. Install the dependencies**

We assume that GeoNode is already installed on your machine.
In addition to that you need to install osmosis, which is used by the Makefile to handle OSM data.
In order to do so, follow the instructions at `Installing pre-built Osmosis <http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis/Installation#Linux>`_

**3. Launch the Makefile for the first time**

Set the current directory to the directory where the Makefile is stored.
Then launch it by typing the following command::

  make all NAME=<country> URL="<Planet.osm mirror>"

Substitute in the command *<country>* with the name of your country of interest (e.g. *malawi*), if you're working on a specific country (the name is used for naming the staging files created by the procedure).

Also replace *<Planet.osm mirror>* with one of the mirrors listed in http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm#Downloading; make sure that the mirror publishes extracts in .pbf format. One handy mirror is http://download.openstreetmap.fr/extracts, which published data on a country or area basis: this allows to reduce the processing steps to a single country or area of interest.

The procedure is going to create a new database in your PostgreSQL instance and store in it the OSM data for your country. Therefore you should run the Makefile with a user that has enough privileges.

The features and attributes to be included in each table and consequently in each GeoNode layer are defined in configuration files which are stored in the conf directory.

A few indications on the computing resources: 30 seconds of computing time are required for processing a .pbf file sized 38MB (the country of Malawi) with an Amazon m3 medium instance (1 Intel Xeon E5-2670 CPU, 3.75GB RAM).

**4. Publish the layers in GeoNode**

We propose to do so in two steps: firstly publish the layers in GeoServer and then in GeoNode.
In GeoServer generate a new Store so that you can keep it separate from the default GeoNode Store. Then publish the layers of your interest from the ones that were created by the procedure at the previous step (please note that some of them may be empty, depending on the country of interest).
In GeoNode take advantage of the updatelayers command and publish all layers from the GeoServer Workspace created ad-hoc at the previous step. See the `updatelayers documentation <http://docs.geonode.org/en/master/tutorials/admin/admin_mgmt_commands/>`_ for details.

**5. Customize the sh file**

Customize the osm_update.sh file in order to fit your server and software configuration, namely:

- define the installation path (on line 3) for the osmosis software, so that it can be found by the OS
- change the current directory to a working directory of your interest, where temporary files can be stored, deleted and updated (on line 4)
- define the name of the country of interest as well as the url (on line 6) as you did in step 3

**6. Customize the SQL file**

Customize the set_pub_date.sql file in order to fit it for your purpose. In particular substitute the store name *osm_extracts* with the name of the store in which your OSM data are in GeoServer.

**7. Schedule the shell file as a cron job**

Insert the osm_update.sh file in the crontab of your server as a scheduled job. In order to do so, please have a look at the official cron documentation. If you’re using Ubuntu OS, please have a look `here <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto>`_.
