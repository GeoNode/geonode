   :synopsis: Apply filters across layers

Cross layer filtering with GeoServer
====================================

Normal GeoServer operation allows a filter to be applied on each layer in isolation, based on
its attribute and external information (geometry, values) provided by the user.
Cross layer filtering is instead the ability to select features from one layer that bear some
relationship with features coming from another layer.
Common questions that cross layer filters can help answering are:

* find all the ice cream stores located in a public park (point vs polygon)
* find all bus stops within 100m from the National Bank subsidiaries (point vs point, with distance reference)
* find all coastal roads (line VS polygon, assuming we have a set of polygons representing the water areas)

In order to solve these questions with a vanilla GeoServer a client would have to first
use WFS to gather all the geometries satisfying the base conditions (e.g., find the National Bank Subsidiaries),
load and unite them, and then issue a second request to the server in order to get the data from the 
other layer (e.g., the bus stops within 100m from the previously loaded points).

   Round trips without cross layer filtering

The querylayer module
---------------------

The querylayer extension, already installed in the workshop GeoServer instance, provides three new filter
functions that can be used to avoid the client/server extra round trips, and have the server handle the
secondary geometries collection instead.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 25 55
   
   
   * - **Name**
     - **Arguments**
     - **Description**
   * - querySingle
     - ``layer``: String, ``attribute``:String, ``filter``:String
     - Queries the specified ``layer``applying the specified (E)CQL ``filter`` and returns the value of ``attribute`` from the first feature in the result set. The layer name should be qualified (e.g. ``topp:states``), the filter can be ``INCLUDE`` if no filtering is desired
   * - queryCollection
     - ``layer``: String, ``attribute``:String, ``filter``:String
     - Queries the specified ``layer``applying the specified (E)CQL ``filter`` and returns the list of the values from ``attribute`` out of every single feature in the result set. The layer name should be qualified (e.g. ``topp:states``), the filter can be ``INCLUDE`` if no filtering is desired. Will throw an exception if too many results are being collected (see the memory limits section for details)
     
   * - collectGeometries
     - ``geometries``: a list of Geometry objects
     - Turns the list of geometries into a single Geometry object, suitable for being used as the reference geometry in spatial filters. Will throw an exception if too many coordinates are being collected (the results of queryCollection cannot be used as is)

These filter functions can be used directly in CQL filters, OGC filters and SLD, meaning they are available
both from WMS and WFS.


Finding all polygonal landmarks crossing a trail
------------------------------------------------

The `following map <http://localhost:8083/geoserver/geosolutions/wms/reflect?layers=geosolutions:bplandmarks,Trails&format=application/openlayers&width=512&height=512&BBOX=-105.31,39.97,-105.26,40.2>`_ , obtained using the WMS reflector to keep the URL short, shows all polygonal landmarks and trails in Boulder (trails are visible when zooming-in due to scale dependencies)::

  http://localhost:8083/geoserver/geosolutions/wms/reflect?layers=geosolutions:bplandmarks,Trails&format=application/openlayers&width=512&height=512&BBOX=-105.31,39.97,-105.26,40.2


.. figure:: img/landmark_trails.png

   Polygonal landmarks and trails in Boulder

Now, let's assume we want to find all polygonal landmarks crossing any trail using the above filter functions.
The first step would be to locate all the trails and extract their geometry attribute (``the_geom``)::

  queryCollection('Trails', 'the_geom', 'INCLUDE')

The above builds a list of geometries that we want to turn into a single ``MULTILINESTRING``, in order to use it as a reference for a ``INTERSECTS`` filter. So we'll call ``collectGeometries``::

  collectGeometries(queryCollection('Trails', 'the_geom', 'INCLUDE'))

Now that we have all the trails in a single geometry object we can use it to build a intersection filter with the polygonal landmarks::

  INTERSECTS(the_geom, collectGeometries(queryCollection('Trails', 'the_geom', 'INCLUDE')))

Since the map contains two layers and we only want to filter on the first, the final CQL filter used in the GetMap request will be::

  INTERSECTS(the_geom, collectGeometries(queryCollection('Trails', 'the_geom', 'INCLUDE')));INCLUDE

The result is that only two polygonal landmarks, the Boulder Mountain Park, and the smaller Buckingham Park, cross any trail:

Finding all buildings located inside a park
-------------------------------------------

In this case we'll start with `this map <http://localhost:8083/geoserver/geosolutions/wms/reflect?layers=geosolutions:bplandmarks,bbuildings&format=application/openlayers&width=512&height=512&&BBOX=-105.29,40.01,-105.28,40.02>`_::

  http://localhost:8083/geoserver/geosolutions/wms/reflect?layers=geosolutions:bplandmarks,bbuildings&format=application/openlayers&width=512&height=512&&BBOX=-105.29,40.01,-105.28,40.02

.. figure:: img/buildings_parks.png

   Buildings and parks in Boulder

The filter construction is similar to the previous case, but this time we need to collect geometries only from parks, which have a ``MTFCC`` attribute equals to ``K2180``::
  
  INCLUDE;INTERSECTS(the_geom, collectGeometries(queryCollection('bplandmarks', 'the_geom', 'MTFCC = ''K2180''')))

Finding all buildings close enough to the Boulder County Courthouse
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In this case we want to find all the buildings close to the Boulder County Courthouse. 
The `reference map <http://localhost:8083/geoserver/geosolutions/wms/reflect?layers=geosolutions:bptlandmarks,bbuildings&format=application/openlayers&width=512&height=512&&BBOX=-105.28061758059,40.016146865234,-105.27475307863,40.021151240234>`_ this time is::

  http://localhost:8083/geoserver/geosolutions/wms/reflect?layers=geosolutions:bptlandmarks,bbuildings&format=application/openlayers&width=512&height=512&&BBOX=-105.28061758059,40.016146865234,-105.27475307863,40.021151240234

.. figure:: img/court_buildings.png

   Boulder County Courthouse surrounded by buildings

This will extract a single geometry that we'll use as a reference, so this time we are going to use the ``querySingle`` function instead, and use the ``DWITHIN`` function to locate all buildings within 400 feet from the courthouse::

  INCLUDE;DWITHIN(the_geom, querySingle('bptlandmarks', 'the_geom', 'FULLNAME = ''Boulder County Courthouse'''), 400, feet)

the resulting map is going to be:
