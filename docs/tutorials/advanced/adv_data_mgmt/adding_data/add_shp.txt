Adding a Shapefile
------------------

The task of adding a Shapefile is one that is core to any GIS tool. This section covers the task of adding and publishing a Shapefile with GeoServer.

#. Navigate to the workshop directory :file:`${TRAINING_ROOT}/data/user_data/` (on Windows :file:`%TRAINING_ROOT%\\data\\user_data`) and find the following shapefiles::

     Mainrd.shp
     Mainrd.shx
     Mainrd.dbf
     Mainrd.prj

   Copy the files to the following directory::

     $GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR/data/boulder
   
   for Windows::
     
        %GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR%\data\boulder
        
        
   .. note:: Ensure that all four parts of the shapefile are copied.  This includes the ``shp``, ``shx``, ``dbf``, and ``prj`` extensions.

#. Navigate to the GeoServer `Welcome Page <http://localhost:8083/geoserver/web/>`_.

#. On the Welcome page locate the :guilabel:`Login` form located at the top right corner, and enter the username "admin" and password "Geos".

#. Click the :guilabel:`Add stores` link.

#. Select the :guilabel:`Shapefile` link and click it.

      Add a new shapefile

   .. note:: The new data source menu contains a list of all the spatial formats supported by GeoServer. When creating a new data store one of these formats must be chosen. Formats like Shapefile and PostGIS are supported by default, and many other formats are available as extensions.

#. On the :guilabel:`Edit Vector Data Source` page enter "Mainrd" in the :guilabel:`Data Source Name` and :guilabel:`Description` fields. Finally click on browse link in order to set the Shapefile location in the :guilabel:`URL` field and click :guilabel:`Save`.

   .. note:: The Mainrd.shp got just copied in the data directory, inside the "data/boulder" folder, and the file browser opens right in the data directory, so just click on "data" and then "boulder" and you'll find it

#. After saving, you will be taken to a page that lists all the layers in the shapefile and gives you the option to publish any of them. Click :guilabel:`Publish`.

      Publishing a layer from the shapefile

#. The :guilabel:`Coordinate Reference Systems` have to be manually populated. The :guilabel:`Name` and :guilabel:`Title` fields should be automatically populated.

      :width: 600
	  
      Populate fields.

   Scroll down the page and generate the bounds for the layer by clicking the :guilabel:`Compute from data` button in the :guilabel:`Bounding Boxes` section.

      Generating the layer bounding box

#. Scroll to the bottom of the page, notice the read only :guilabel:`Feature Type Detail` table and then click :guilabel:`Save`.

      Submitting the layer configuration

#. If all went well, you should see something like this:

      After a successful save

   At this point a shapefile has been added and is ready to be served by GeoServer.

#. Choose the ``preview`` link in the main menu and filter the layer list with ``mainrd``:

   .. figure:: img/preview_shapefile1.png
	  :width: 600
	  
	  Selecting the ``mainrd`` shapefile in the layer preview.

#. Click on the ``OpenLayers`` link to preview the layer in an interactive viewer:

In the :ref:`next <geoserver.shp_postgis>` section we will see how to load a shapeFile into PostGIS.
