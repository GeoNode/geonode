Adding a GeoTIFF
----------------

GeoTIFF is a widely used geospatial raster data format. It is composed of a single file containing both the data and the georeferencing information (not to be confused with the .tiff/.tfw/.prj file triplet, which is considered a "world image" file in GeoServer).
This section provides instructions to add and publish a GeoTIFF file.

#. Open the web browser and navigate to the GeoServer `Welcome Page <http://localhost:8083/geoserver>`_.

#. Select :guilabel:`Add stores` from the interface.

#. Select :guilabel:`GeoTIFF - Tagged Image File Format with Geographic information` from the set of available Raster Data Sources.

#. Specify a proper name (as an instance, :file:`13tde815295_200803_0x6000m_cl`) in the :guilabel:`Data Source Name` field of the interface. 

#. Click on browse link in order to set the GeoTIFF location in the :guilabel:`URL` field.

   .. note:: The 13tde815295_200803_0x6000m_cl.tif is located at :file:`${TRAINING_ROOT}/data/user_data/aerial/13tde815295_200803_0x6000m_cl.tif` (on Windows :file:`%TRAINIG_ROOT%\\data\\user_data\\aerial\\13tde815295_200803_0x6000m_cl.tif`)
