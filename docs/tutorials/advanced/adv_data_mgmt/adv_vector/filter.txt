.. _geoserver.vector_data.filter:

Filtering and Extracting vector data
------------------------------------

WFS also defines mechanisms to only retrieve a subset of the data that matches some specified constraints.

#. Create a new ``request.xml`` file in the training root and past the following request into it::
 
    <wfs:GetFeature xmlns:wfs='http://www.opengis.net/wfs'
      xmlns:ogc='http://www.opengis.net/ogc' service='WFS' version='1.0.0'>
      <Query typeName='geosolutions:WorldCountries'>
        <ogc:Filter>
          <ogc:FeatureId fid='WorldCountries.137' />
        </ogc:Filter>
      </Query>
    </wfs:GetFeature>

#. Go on the command line, move to the training folder root, and execute the request using CURL::

    curl -XPOST -d @request.xml -H "Content-type: application/xml" "http://localhost:8083/geoserver/ows"


#. Now, let's write an equivalent request - using the name of the state instead of the ``id``- issuing a ``GET`` and encoding the filter in a language called `CQL <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CQL>`_. Copy the following  URL in your browser's navigation bar::

    http://localhost:8083/geoserver/wfs?request=GetFeature&service=WFS&version=1.0.0&typeName=geosolutions:WorldCountries&outputFormat=GML2&CQL_FILTER=NAME=%27Monaco%27

      The CQL filter in the Firefox URL bar

   .. figure:: img/cql_filter_result.png
 
      The results of the CQL filter

That's how a feature set is filtered with either the OGC encoding or the CQL notation.

In the :ref:`next <geoserver.vector_data.wfst>` section we will see how to edit the features via a protocol called WFS Transactional (WFS-T).
