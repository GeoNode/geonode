Using the ImageMosaic plugin with footprint management
=======================================================


Introduction
------------

This section describes how to associate a vector footprint to a raster dataset in GeoServer using the ImageMosaic plugin.

**A vector footprint is a shape used as a mask for the mosaic**. Masking can be useful for hiding pixels which are meaningless, or for enhancing only few regions of the image in respect to others.

This chapter contains two sub-sections:

* The first sub-section, **Configuration**, describes the possible configurations needed to set up an ImageMosaic with footprint.
* The second sub-section, **Examples**, provides examples of configuration of an ImageMosaic with footprint.

Configuration
-------------
A vector footprint can be linked to an ImageMosaic in three different ways:

1.	By using for each mosaic granule a **Sidecar File**, a Shapefile with the same filename of the granule which contains the footprint for it;
2.  By using a single Shapefile called **footprints.shp** which contains all the footprints for each granule; each feature contained in the shapefile represent a footprint for an ImageMosaic granule. Each footprint is associated to a granule with the *location* attribute;
3.  By using a file called **footprints.properties**, this option add more flexibility to the option number 2. 

The last option allows to write the following configuration inside the **footprints.properties** file::
	
	footprint_source=*location of the Shapefile*
	footprint_filter=*filter on the Shapefile searching for the attribute associated to each granule*

So the user is free to decide the Shapefile name to use (not only footprints.shp) and the attribute to use for the footprint granule association adding also a custom filter for the content of that attribute.

The **footprint.properties** can be used also to hold other kind of configurations, see the *Inset Support* paragraph below.
	
For example if a Shapefile called **fakeShapeFile** stores the various footprints in a table like this, where each *Name* attribute is referred to a granule file:

	.. figure:: img/shp_table.png
	
And the associated granules are:

	* ortho_1-1_1n_s_la087_2010_1.tif
	* ortho_2-2_1n_s_la075_2010_1.tif
	* ortho_1-1_1n_s_la103_2010_1.tif
	* and so on ...
	
The associated **footprints.properties** file must be like this::
	
	footprint_source=fakeShapeFile.shp
	footprint_filter=Name=strSubstring(granule.location, 0, strLength(granule.location) - 4)

The **substring** operation is done for comparing the footprint attribute names and the granule names without the *.tif* extension.
Standard GeoServer Filter Functions can be use in this expression. A complete reference for them can be found `here <http://docs.geoserver.org/2.6.x/en/user/filter/function_reference.html#string-functions>`_.

Footprint Behaviours
+++++++++++++++++++++

There are three possible behaviours for Footprint:
	
	* *None*: simply doesn't use the Footprint and behaves like a standard ImageMosaic layer;
	* *Transparent*: adds an alpha band of 0s on the image portions outside of the Footprint making them transparent, typically used for RGB data;
	* *Cut*: set the background value on the image portions outside of the Footprint, typically used for grayscale data.
	
The behaviour must be set directly on the Layer configuration page.

Inset Support
+++++++++++++++

Another feature of the *Footprint* is the possibility to calculate an **Inset** on the vector footprint prior to applying it to the image. With the *Inset* a shrinking of the footprint is applied, typically for removing compression artefacts or any nasty effect at the borders. The inset can be activated by adding the following code inside **footprints.properties**::

	footprint_inset=*value in the shapefile u.o.m.*
	footprint_inset_type=*full/border*
	
  * **Full** inset type calculates the inset for each footprint side 
  * **Border** does the same operation but those straight lines that overlap the image bounds are avoided; this last parameter is useful for images already cut in a regular grid.

Each modification of the **footprints.properties** file requires to *Reload* GeoServer. This operation can be achieved by going to :guilabel:`Server Status` and clicking on the 
:guilabel:`Reload` button on the bottom-right side of the page.

Examples
--------

The two datasets used in the following can be found into 

  * Linux: :file:`${TRAINING_ROOT}/data/user_data/footprint_data`
  * Windows :file:`%TRAINING_ROOT%\\data\\user_data\\footprint_data`

The content of the footprint_data is:
  
  * The first dataset, *mosaic_single_tiff*, contains a Shapefile called *srtm_boulder.shp* which represents a mask to use on the Boulder (Colorado) layer inside the :file:`${TRAINING_ROOT}/data/user_data/boulder` folder and can be used for testing footprint configuration with a *Sidecar File*.
  * The second dataset, *mosaic_sample*, is a mosaic which represents Italy and is used for testing the other two configurations.
 
Here are presented a few steps for configuring a new ImageMosaic layer with footprint.

1. Vector Footprint configured with a sidecar file
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Here the steps to load an ImageMosaic with a sidecar file as a vector footprint.

Step 1: Create a new ImageMosaic Layer
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

As seen in a previous chapter an ImageMosaic data store can be created by going to :menuselection:`Stores --> Add New Store --> ImageMosaic`.

Load the *mosaic_single_tiff* folder, from the TRAINING_ROOT folder navigate to :file:`\\data\\user_data\\footprint_data\\mosaic_single_tiff`

.. figure:: img/mosaic_single_tiff.png

Publish a Layer from that store going to :menuselection:`Layers --> Add New Resource`, choosing the name of the data store created above and then clicking on the :guilabel:`publish` button.


Step 2: Configuring a new Layer for the Mosaic
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. warning:: fill the field **Declared CRS** with the value ``EPSG:4326`` if the CRS is not automatically set.

The layer will be rendered depending on the value of the *FootprintBehavior* field:

	.. figure:: img/footprint_behav.png
	
The user can set one of the three values for the Footprint behaviour as described above (*None*, *Transparent*, *Cut*).
	
After that, the user must confirm the modification by clicking on the :guilabel:`Save` button on the bottom side of the page.

Step 3: Example Results
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Here are presented the results for each dataset.

This is an example of mosaic (*mosaic_single_tiff*) without applying Footprint:
	
	.. figure:: img/footprint_normal.png
	
And this is the result of setting **FootprintBehavior** to *Cut*:

	.. figure:: img/footprint_cut.png
	
Then navigate the filesystem in the mosaic directory, open (or create it if not exist) the file footprints.properties and write::

     footprint_inset=0.01
     footprint_inset_type=full

to add an inset.
	 
.. note:: Remember that each modification on **footprints.properties** requires a GeoServer catalog and a GeoServer resource cache reloading in order to apply the changes.

If an Inset is added, the final mosaic is:

	.. figure:: img/footprint_cut_inset.png

2. Vector Footprint configured with footprints.shp
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Repeat the steps described above but loading the *mosaic_sample* folder from :file:`%TRAINING_ROOT%\\data\\user_data\\footprint_data\\mosaic_sample`

This is another example of mosaic (*mosaic_sample*) without Footprint:

	.. figure:: img/footprint_mosaic_none.png
	
And now after setting **FootprintBehavior** to *Transparent* (no Inset is used) on the Layer:

	.. figure:: img/footprint_mosaic.png
	
3. Vector Footprint configured with *footprints.properties*
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For testing this functionality the user must  
	
	* Clone the directory :file:`%TRAINING_ROOT%\\data\\user_data\\footprint_data\\mosaic_sample` and call it ``mosaic_sample2``
	* Rename all the *footprints.xxx* files that compose the shapefile to *mask.xxx* (don't rename *footprints.properties* too!) and load another ImageMosaic datastore.
	* open (create if not exist) the **footprints.properties** file and write::
	
		footprint_source=mask.shp
		footprint_inset=0.00001
		footprint_inset_type=border

         In order to specify an inset and use a footprint shapefile with a custom name.
     
	* Then publish the ImageMosaic located in the cloned directory called ``mosaic_sample2``

The result of setting **FootprintBehavior** to *Transparent*, Inset type to *border* and Inset value to 0.00001 is:

	.. figure:: img/footprint_mosaic_prop.png
