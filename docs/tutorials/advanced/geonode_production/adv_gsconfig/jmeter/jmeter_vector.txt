Configuring JMeter for testing Vector data
================================================

The following section compare vector data preparation using Shapefile and PostGis. For this example a Shapefile containing primary or secondary roads is used.

The purpose is to test the throughput between the shapefile and an optimized database containing the same data. The result will demonstrate that database optimization can provide a better
throughput than the one of the shapefile


Configuring the database
---------------------------------

#. Open the terminal and go to the ``%TRAINING_ROOT%``

#. Load the shapefile ``tl_2014_01_prisecroads`` located in ``%TRAINING_ROOT%\data\user_data`` into PostGIS with the following commands:

	.. code-block:: xml
		
		setenv.bat
		
		createdb -U postgres -T postgis20 shape2
		
		shp2pgsql -k -I "data\user_data\tl_2014_01_prisecroads\tl_2014_01_prisecroads.shp" public.pgroads | psql -U postgres -d shape2

	.. note:: More information can be found at :ref:`Loading a Shapefile into PostGIS <geoserver.shp_postgis>`

#. On the ``%TRAINING_ROOT%`` run **pgAdmin.bat**

#. Go to the table ``pgroads`` inside database ``shape2`` and execute the following SQL script for creating an index on the *MTFCC* column:

	.. code-block:: sql
		
		CREATE INDEX mtfcc_idx ON pgroads ("MTFCC");
		
	.. figure:: img/jmeter46.png
		:align: center
   
		*Create a new index*
	
   The following index optimizes the access to the database when filtering on the *MTFCC* column.
	
Configuring GeoServer
---------------------------------

#. On your Web browser, navigate to the GeoServer `Welcome Page <http://localhost:8083/geoserver/>`_.

#. Following the instructions on :ref:`Adding a Postgis layer <geoserver.postgis_lay>`, configure the database ``shape2`` in GeoServer and call it **pgroads**

	.. note:: Note that the database `Coordinate Reference System` is ``EPSG:4269``

#. Configure the shapefile ``tl_2014_01_prisecroads`` used before in GeoServer following the instructions in :ref:`Adding a Shapefile <geoserver.add_shp>` and call it **allroads**

	.. note:: Note that the shapefile `Coordinate Reference System` is ``EPSG:4269``

#. Go to :guilabel:`Styles` and click on ``Add new Style``

#. On the bottom of the page, click on :guilabel:`Choose File` and select the SLD file called ``shproads`` in the ``$TRAINING_ROOT/data/jmeter_data`` directory

#. Click on :guilabel:`Upload` and then on :guilabel:`Submit`. This new style supports scale dependency which is used as filter on the roads to display.

Configuring JMeter
---------------------------------

#. Go to ``$TRAINING_ROOT/data/jmeter_data`` and copy the file ``template.jmx`` file creating a ``vector.jmx`` file.

#. From the training root, on the command line, run ``jmeter.bat`` (or ``jmeter.sh`` if you're on Linux) to start JMeter

#. On the top left go to :guilabel:`File --> Open` and search for the new *jmx* file copied

#. In the ``CSV Data Set Config`` element, modify the **path** of the CSV file by setting the path for the file ``shp2pg.csv`` in the ``$TRAINING_ROOT/data/jmeter_data`` directory
	  
#. In the **HTTP Request Default** element modify the following parameters:

	.. list-table::
		  :widths: 30 50

		  * - **Name**
		    - **Value**
		  * - layers
		    - geosolutions:allroads
		  * - srs
		    - EPSG:4269
		  * - styles
		    - shproads
	
Test the Shapefile
------------------

#. Run the test. You should see something like this:

	.. figure:: img/jmeter47.png
		:align: center
   
		*Sample request on the Shapefile*	
	  
	.. note:: Remember to run and stop the test a few times for having stable results

#. When the test is completed, Save the results in a text file.
	
#. Remove the result from JMeter by clicking on :guilabel:`Run --> Clear All` on the menu

Test the Database
------------------------
	
#. In the **HTTP Request Default** element modify the following parameter:

	.. list-table::
		  :widths: 30 50

		  * - **Name**
		    - **Value**
		  * - layers
		    - geosolutions:pgroads

#. Run the test again. It should be noted that database throughput is greater than that of the Shapefile, because the new index created provides a faster access on the database, improving GeoServer performances
