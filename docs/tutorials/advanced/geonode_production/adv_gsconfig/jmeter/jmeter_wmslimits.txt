Configuring JMeter for testing WMS Resource Limits
==================================================

The following section explains how GeoServer performances are improved when setting the resource limits for WMS.

Preliminary Steps
-----------------

#. Open your Web browser and navigate to the GeoServer `Welcome Page <http://localhost:8083/geoserver/>`_.

#. Go to :guilabel:`Stores` and select ``storms`` DataStore

#. Change the following parameters:

		.. list-table::
		  :widths: 30 50

		  * - **Name**
		    - **Value**
		  * - max connections
		    - 1
		  * - Connection timeout
		    - 20000000
	It should appear something like this:
		
	   .. figure:: img/jmeter30.png
		:align: center

		*Change `storms` parameters*
			
	Now you have configured this store to enqueue all the requests in a single queue until they are not timed out.

Configure JMeter
----------------
	
#. Go to ``$TRAINING_ROOT/data/jmeter_data`` and copy the file ``template.jmx`` file and create ``limit.jmx``

#. From the training root, on the command line, run ``jmeter.bat`` (or ``jmeter.sh`` if you're on Linux) to start JMeter

#. On the top left go to :guilabel:`File --> Open` and search for the new *jmx* file copied

#. Disable all the **Thread Groups** except for the **64** one in order to create a test environment with multiple concurrent requests to be enqueued. 

#. In the ``CSV Data Set Config`` element, modify the **path** of the CSV file by setting the path for the file ``limits.csv`` in the ``$TRAINING_ROOT/data/jmeter_data`` directory
	  
#. In the **HTTP Request Default** element modify the following parameters:

	.. list-table::
		  :widths: 30 50

		  * - **Name**
		    - **Value**
		  * - layers
		    - geosolutions:storm_obs
		  * - srs
		    - EPSG:4326
	
	
Test without WMS Limits
-----------------------

#. Run the test

	.. note:: Remember to run and stop the test a few times for having stable results

#. You should see something like this:

	     .. figure:: img/jmeter31.png
		   :align: center

		   *View Results Tree*
   
#. When the test is completed, Save the results in a text file and remove them from the console by clicking on :guilabel:`Run --> Clear All` on the menu

Configure WMS Limits
--------------------

#. On your Web browser, navigate to the GeoServer `Welcome Page <http://localhost:8083/geoserver/>`_.

#. Go to :guilabel:`WMS` and edit the :guilabel:`Raster Rendering Options` section: 

		.. list-table::
		  :widths: 30 50

		  * - **Name**
		    - **Value**
		  * - Max rendering time
		    - 10
			
	     .. figure:: img/jmeter32.png
		   :align: center

		   *Changing WMS limit configuration*
		   
	With this option, GeoServer will cut off all the requests that need more than 10s to be rendered, making GeoServer more responsive. Note that this 
	will result in various error returned by GeoServer for those operations which are cut off. 
	You can choose another value to set. For having a good result you should take a value minor than the average response time of the first test.

Test with WMS Limits
--------------------

#. Run again the test. You should see multiple errors like this:

	   .. figure:: img/jmeter33.png
		:align: center

		*Exceptions caused by maximum rendering limit exceeded*
		
	You may see that the throughput is increased because most of the timed out requests have been removed. With this kind of configuration you can control the responsiveness 
	of your GeoServer by removing stale requests instead of waiting for them.
	
.. note:: At the end of the test remove the limits and restore the previous configuration of the ``storms`` DataStore
