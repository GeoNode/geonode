Configuring JMeter for testing Raster optimization
==================================================

The following section explains how the GeoServer performances improves with the optimization of raster files. 

Optimization has already been discussed in the :ref:`Introduction To Processing With GDAL <geoserver.processing>` sections, describing the most common techniques used.

.. note:: This section requires the layers published in the :ref:`Adding an Image Mosaic <geoserver.mosaic>`, :ref:`Introduction To Processing With GDAL <geoserver.processing>` and :ref:`Advanced Mosaics Configuration <geoserver.mosaic_pyramid>` sections.

Test the Unoptimized Mosaic
---------------------------

#. Go to ``$TRAINING_ROOT/data/jmeter_data`` and copy the file ``template.jmx`` file, creating a ``mosaic.jmx`` file

#. From the training root, on the command line, run ``jmeter.bat`` (or ``jmeter.sh`` if you're on Linux) to start JMeter

#. On the top left go to :guilabel:`File --> Open` and search for the new *jmx* file copied

#. Disable the Thread Groups **8**, **16**, **32**, **64** by right-clicking on them and selecting `Disable`. 
	  
#. In the ``CSV Data Set Config`` element of the remaining thread groups, modify the **path** of the CSV file by setting the path for the file ``optimized.csv`` in the ``$TRAINING_ROOT/data/jmeter_data`` directory
	  
#. In the **HTTP Request Default** element modify the following parameters:

	.. list-table::
		  :widths: 30 50

		  * - **Name**
		    - **Value**
		  * - layers
		    - geosolutions:boulder_bg
		  * - srs
		    - EPSG:26913

At this point JMeter is configured to run a GeoServer performance test:

#. Run the test

	.. note:: Remember to run and stop the test a few times for having stable results

#. You should see something like this:

	   .. figure:: img/jmeter29.png
		:align: center

		*`View Results Tree` panel*
   
#. When the test is completed, Save the results in a text file and remove them from the console by clicking on :guilabel:`Run --> Clear All` on the menu

Test the Optimized Mosaic
---------------------------

#. In the **HTTP Request Default** section modify the following parameter:

	.. list-table::
		  :widths: 30 50

		  * - **Name**
		    - **Value**
		  * - layers
		    - geosolutions:boulder_bg_optimized

#. Run the test again
   
#. Compare the results of this test with the ones saved before. **You should see that throughput is increased with the optimized Mosaic**
