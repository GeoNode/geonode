Configuring JMeter for a simple test
------------------------------------

Apache JMeter is an open source Java desktop application, built to verify functional behavior, perform load tests, and measure performance. 

This section explains how to run performance tests using JMeter in order to evaluate the GeoServer performances when serving WMS requests.
The performance test aim to stress the server and evaluate  the response time and throughput with an increasing number of simulated users 
sending concurrent request to the server. 

.. note:: Ideally, to avoid adding extra load to the server JMeter should run on a different machine. 

.. warning:: If you have performed the exercises in the security section, please go back to the layer and
          service security pages and open access to everybody, on all data and all services, before performing
          the exercises in this section

#. From the training root, on the command line, run ``jmeter.bat`` (or ``jmeter.sh`` if you're on Linux) to start JMeter:

      *jMeter interface*

#. Add a new **Thread Group** with the mouse right click on ``Test Plan`` tree node:

      *Adding a new Thread Group*

#. Add a new **Loop Controller** with the mouse right click on ``Thread Group`` tree node:

      :align: center
   
      *Adding a new Loop Controller*

#. In the ``Thread Group`` panel set the number of thread for the test to  4 (this represents the number of simultaneous requests that are made to GeoServer) and the ramp-up period to 60. Also, chek ``Forever`` on the **Loop Count** field.

      *Setting the Thread Group*

#. Right click on the ``Loop Controller`` tree node and add a new **HTTP Request** element:

      *Adding a new HTTP Request*

#. Add the following listeners by right clicking on ``Test Plan`` tree node: ``View results Tree``, ``Summary Report``, ``Graph results``

      *Adding a Listeners*

#. In the **HTTP Request** enter the following basic configuration:

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 50 50
      :header-rows: 1
  
      * - Field
        - Value
      * - Server Name or IP
        - localhost
      * - Port Number
        - 8083
      * - Path
        - geoserver/ows

   .. figure:: img/jmeter9.png
      :align: center
   
      *HTTP Request host/port/path configuration*

#. From the training data dir root, open the ``data/jmeter_data/jmeter_request_params.txt``, select and copy its contents in the clipboard, then click "Add from Clipboard" in the "HTTP request" panel to setup a sample GetMap request:

     *HTTP parameters configuration*

At this point jMeter is configured to run a GeoServer performance test:

#. Select on **Thread Group** tree node and afted click on ``Run`` tool and select **Start** to startig the jMeter test.

#. Select ``View Results Tree`` to directly see the request informations produced and the request result:

      *The View Results Tree panel*
   
#. Select ``Suymmary report`` to view the statistical information about the requests:

      *The Aggregate Graph panel*

#. Select ``Graph Results`` to analyze the technical trend of the requests:
