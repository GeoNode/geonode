Configuring JMeter for testing Style optimization
=================================================

The following section explains how GeoServer performances are improved when using optimized styles. Styling is an important feature for GeoServer, but requires some 
attention in order to avoid slowing down the performances. 

This tutorial is aimed to show how GeoServer performances change by choosing a different style for the same data set using JMeter. 

.. note:: This example requires to have already completed the first 9 steps of the :ref:`Creating a Base Map with a Layer Group <geoserver.base_map>` section, :ref:`Adding a Shapefile <geoserver.add_shp>` and :ref:`Adding a Style <geoserver.add_style>` sections .


Configuring GeoServer
-----------------------

#. On your Web browser, navigate to the GeoServer `Welcome Page <http://localhost:8083/geoserver/>`_.

#. Go to :guilabel:`Styles` and click on ``Add new Style``

#. On the bottom of the page, click on :guilabel:`Choose File` and select the SLD file called ``line_label`` in the ``$TRAINING_ROOT/data/jmeter_data`` directory

#. Click on :guilabel:`Upload` and then on :guilabel:`Submit`. Now we have a style which supports labeling but has no control on the label conflicts and overlapping

#. Return to the GeoServer `Welcome Page <http://localhost:8083/geoserver/>`_.

#. Go to :guilabel:`Layer Groups` and click on ``test``

#. Add a new Layer to the Layer Group called **bbuildings**

		*Add a new Layer to the Layer Group*

#. Change the associated styles by clicking on each style and choosing another one on the list. Use the following styles:

	.. list-table::
		  :widths: 30 50

		  * - **Layer**
		    - **Style**
		  * - geosolutions:Mainrd
		    - line_label
		  * - geosolutions:BoulderCityLimits
		    - polygon
		  * - geosolutions:bplandmarks
		    - polygon
		  * - geosolutions:bbuildings
		    - polygon

	.. figure:: img/jmeter37.png
		:align: center
   
		*Styles configuration*	  

#. Click on :guilabel:`Save`. With this configuration we have a Layer Group composed by 4 Layers with 4 bad styles associated. This will result in a low throughput, if compared to that of the test with optimized styles.
	  
Configuring JMeter
------------------
	
#. Go to ``$TRAINING_ROOT/data/jmeter_data`` and copy the file ``template.jmx`` file and create a ``styles.jmx`` one

#. From the training root, on the command line, run ``jmeter.bat`` (or ``jmeter.sh`` if you're on Linux) to start JMeter

#. On the top left go to :guilabel:`File --> Open` and search for the new *jmx* file copied

#. Disable **Thread Group** **8**, **16**, **32** and **64**

#. In the ``CSV Data Set Config`` element, modify the **path** of the CSV file by setting the path for the file ``style.csv`` in the ``$TRAINING_ROOT/data/jmeter_data`` directory
	  
#. In the **HTTP Request Default** element modify the following parameters:

	.. list-table::
		  :widths: 30 50

		  * - **Name**
		    - **Value**
		  * - layers
		    - test
		  * - srs
		    - EPSG:2876	
	
Test with unoptimized styles
----------------------------

#. Run the test. You should see something like this:

	.. figure:: img/jmeter38.png
		:align: center
   
		*View Results Tree panel with a bad styling*
	  
	.. note:: Remember to run and stop the test a few times for having stable results

#. When the test is completed, Save the results in a text file.
	
#. Remove the result from JMeter by clicking on :guilabel:`Run --> Clear All` on the menu

Setting optimized styles
--------------------------

#. Go to :guilabel:`Layer Groups` and click on ``test``

#. Change the associated styles by clicking on each style and choosing another one on the list. Use the following styles:

	.. list-table::
		  :widths: 30 50

		  * - **Layer**
		    - **Style**
		  * - geosolutions:Mainrd
		    - mainrd
		  * - geosolutions:BoulderCityLimits
		    - citylimits
		  * - geosolutions:bplandmarks
		    - arealandmarks
		  * - geosolutions:bbuildings
		    - buildings

	.. figure:: img/jmeter39.png
		:align: center
   
		*Styles configuration*	  

#. Click on :guilabel:`Save`. The new styles contain scale dependencies and label optimization, which will result in a better throughput. 
		
Test with optimized styles
--------------------------

#. Run again the test.

	.. figure:: img/jmeter40.png
		:align: center
   
		*View Results Tree panel with good styling*	
		
	You may see that the throughput is greater than that of the first test. The use of scale dependencies reduces the layers to see at lower zoom levels while conflict resolution avoids to show multiple overlapping label at each zoom level.
