Configuring JMeter for testing GeoWebCache fullWMS support
==========================================================

The following section compare GeoServer WMS with GeoWebCache ``fullWMS`` support. ``FullWMS`` is a new feature which allows GeoWebCache to act as a WMS endpoint, like GeoServer.
Using GeoWebCache, the server is able to cache the requested tiles in order to return them faster then GeoServer. 

This example will show how to configure GeoWebCache with fullWMS support and how the performances are improved.


Configuring GeoServer/GeoWebCache
---------------------------------

#. On your Web browser, navigate to the GeoServer `Welcome Page <http://localhost:8083/geoserver/>`_.

#. Go to :guilabel:`Gridsets` and click on ``Create a new gridest``

#. Call it ``EPSG_2876`` and set ``EPSG:2876`` as :guilabel:`Coordinate Reference System`

#. Click on :guilabel:`Compute from maximum extent of CRS` and add 15 new **Zoom Levels** (from 0 to 14)by clicking on :guilabel:`Add zoom level`. It should look like this picture:

	.. figure:: img/jmeter41.png
		:align: center
   
		*Create a new Gridset*

#. Click on :guilabel:`Save`. Now this `GridSet` can be added to the Layer Group ``boulder`` for caching it with GeoWebCache

#. Go to :guilabel:`Layer Groups` and click on ``boulder``

#. On the :guilabel:`Available gridsets` panel add the gridset ``EPSG_2876`` from the list. Then click on :guilabel:`Save`. 

	.. figure:: img/jmeter42.png
		:align: center
   
		*Add the new Gridset*

	.. note:: Remember to set :guilabel:`Published zoom levels` to ``Min`` and ``Max``
	  
Configuring JMeter
------------------
	
#. Go to ``$TRAINING_ROOT/data/jmeter_data`` and copy the file ``template.jmx`` file into ``gwc.jmx``

#. From the training root, on the command line, run ``jmeter.bat`` (or ``jmeter.sh`` if you're on Linux) to start JMeter

#. On the top left go to :guilabel:`File --> Open` and search for the new *jmx* file copied

#. Disable all the **Thread Groups** except for **8**

#. Disable the **Content-Type Check**

#. In the ``CSV Data Set Config`` element, modify the **path** of the CSV file by setting the path for the file ``gwc.csv`` in the ``$TRAINING_ROOT/data/jmeter_data`` directory
	  
#. In the **HTTP Request Default** element modify the following parameters:

	.. list-table::
		  :widths: 30 50

		  * - **Name**
		    - **Value**
		  * - layers
		    - boulder
		  * - srs
		    - EPSG:2876	
	
Test GeoServer WMS
------------------

#. Run the test
	  
	.. note:: Remember to run and stop the test a few times for having stable results

#. When the test is completed, Save the results in a text file.
	
#. Remove the result from JMeter by clicking on :guilabel:`Run --> Clear All` on the menu

#. Stop GeoServer

Test GeoWebCache fullWMS
------------------------

#. Go to ``$TRAINING_ROOT/data/gwc/geowebcache.xml`` and add the following snippet:

	.. code-block:: xml
		
		<gwcConfiguration>
		
		  ...
		  
		  <fullWMS>true</fullWMS>
		</gwcConfiguration>
		
	Setting ``fullWMS`` to `true` allows GeoWebCache to use fullWMS support

#. Restart GeoServer
	
#. On the JMeter **HTTP Request Default** panel, change the *Path* from ``geoserver/ows`` to ``geoserver/gwc/service/wms`` in order to execute WMS requests directly to GeoWebCache, without passing from GeoServer

#. Add a new parameter called **hints** which can have 3 values ``speed``, ``default`` and ``quality``. The first one should be used for having a faster response without concerning about image quality; the last one, instead, is slower but with a better quality; the second one is a good trade off between them. For the first test set **hints** to ``speed``. 	  

#. Run the test

	.. note:: At the first run, the throughput should be lower than that of GeoServer, because GeoWebCache has spent much time on generating the cached tiles.

#. Remove the result from JMeter by clicking on :guilabel:`Run --> Clear All` on the menu

#. Run the same test again.

	Now the throughput should be improved, because GeoWebCache have already generated the tiles to cache and can reuse them. Image quality should be very poor because of the ``hints=speed`` configuration.

	.. figure:: img/jmeter43.png
		:align: center
   
		*Result from GeoWebCache fullWMS with hints=speed*
	
#. Run the same test with ``hints=default``

	.. figure:: img/jmeter44.png
		:align: center
   
		*Result from GeoWebCache fullWMS with hints=default*

#. Run the same test with ``hints=quality``

	.. figure:: img/jmeter45.png
		:align: center
   
		*Result from GeoWebCache fullWMS with hints=quality*
		
	It should be noted that changing the ``hints`` parameter changes the image quality, but the throughput is always greater than that of GeoServer WMS
