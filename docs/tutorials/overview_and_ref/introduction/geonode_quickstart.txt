GeoNode Quickstart
==================
Open Source Geospatial Content Management System

GeoNode is a web-based application and platform for developing geospatial information systems (GIS) and for deploying spatial data infrastructures (SDI).

In this Quickstart guide you will learn the following:

    #. to register a new account to get started
    #. add a new layer
    #. create a map using your new layer
    #. share your map with others

Start GeoNode on your Live DVD or local VM and redirect your browser at `http://localhost:8000/ <http://localhost:8000/>`_ (this is the default port).
The page will look like shown in the image below.

    *Welcome page*

1. Register a new account
=========================

From the interface shown above, one can view and modify existing spatial layers and maps, as well as find information on other GeoNode users.
But, without being logged in, you are limited to read-only access of public layers.
In order to create a map and add layers to it, you have to have create an account first.

    #. From any page in the web interface, you will see a *Sign in* link. Click that link, and in the dialog that displays, click the *Register now* link.

        .. image:: img/signin_quickstart.png

           :alt: Sign in Form
        *Sign in Form*

    #. On the next page, fill out the form. Enter a user name and password in the fields. Also, enter your email address for verification.

        .. image:: img/signup1.png
           :width: 500px
           :alt: Register Form
        *Register Form*

    #. You will be returned to the welcome page. An email will be sent confirming that you have signed up. While you are now logged in, you will need to confirm your account. Navigate to the link that was sent in the email.

        .. image:: img/confirm1.png
           :width: 500px
           :alt: Confirm
        *Confirm*

    #. By clicking *Confirm* you will be returned to the homepage. Now you’ve registered an account, you are able to add layers to it as well as create maps and share those with other users.


2. Add a new layer
==================

Layers are a published resource representing a raster or vector spatial data source. Layers also can be associated with metadata, ratings, and comments.

    #. To add a layer to your account, navigate to the welcome page. There the following toolbar can be seen:

        .. image:: img/toolbar_quickstart.png
           :width: 500px
           :alt: Toolbar
        *Toolbar*

    #. By clicking the *Layers* link you will be brought to the *Layers* menu where a new subtoolbar can be seen. This toolbar allows you to *Explore*, *Search* and *Upload* layers.

        .. image:: img/layerstoolbar_quickstart.png
           :width: 500px
           :alt: Upload Button
        *Upload Button*

    #. Now click *Upload Layers* and you’ll see the upload form.

        .. image:: img/uploadform_new_quickstart.png
           :width: 500px
           :alt: Upload Form
        *Upload Form*

    #. You have two possibilities to add your files. You can either do that by using *drag & drop* or you choose to *browse* them. Be aware that you have to upload a complete set of files, consisting of a **shp**, a **prj**, a **dbf** and a **shx** file. If one of them is missing, GeoNode will warn you before you upload them.

    #. You shold now be able to see all the files you want to upload.

        .. image:: img/files_to_be_uploaded.png
           :width: 500px
           :alt: Files to be Uploaded
        *Files to be Uploaded*

    #. GeoNode has the ability to restrict who can view, edit, and manage layers. On the right side of the page you can see the *Permission* section, where you can limit the access on your layer. Under **Who can view and download this data**, select **Any registered user**. This will ensure that *Anonymous* view access is disabled. In the same area, under **Who can edit this data**, select **your username**. This will ensure that *Only You* are able to edit the data in the layer.

        .. image:: img/permission.png
           :width: 250px
           :alt: Permissions
        *Permissions*

    #. To upload data, click the *Upload* button at the bottom.

3. Create a new map
===================

The next step for you is to create a map and add the newly created layers to this map.

    #. Click the *Maps* link on the top toolbar. This will bring up the list of maps.

        .. image:: img/maps_quickstart.png
           :width: 500px
           :alt: Create new Map Button
        *Create new Map Button*

    #. Currently, there aren’t any maps here. To add one click the *Create a New Map* button and a map composition interface will display.

        .. image:: img/createmap1.png
           :width: 500px
           :alt: Maps Editor
        *Maps Editor*

        In this interface there is a toolbar, layer list, and map window. The map window contains the MapQuest OpenStreetMap layer by default.
        There are other service layers available here as well: Blue Marble, Bing Aerial With Labels, MapQuest, and OpenStreetMap.

    #. Click on the *New Layers* button and select *Add Layers*.

        .. image:: img/addlayerslink1.png
           :alt: Add Layers
        *Add Layers*

    #. Now you should be able to see all the availabel layers. In your case, this should only be the ones you’ve added before (San Andreas?).

    #. Select all of the layers by clicking the top entry and **Shift-clicking** the bottom one. Click *Add Layers* to add them all to the map.

        .. image:: img/addlayersselect_quickstart.png
           :alt: Add Layers
        *Add Layers*

    #. The layers will be added to the map. Click *Done* (right next to *Add Layers* at the bottom) to return to the main layers list.

    #. To save the map click on the Map button in the toolbar, and select *Save Map*.

        .. image:: img/savemaplink1.png
           :alt: Save Map
        *Save Map*

    #. Enter a title and abstract for your map.

        .. image:: img/savemapdialog1.png
           :alt: Edit Map Metadata
        *Edit Map Metadata*

    #. Click *Save*. Notice that the link on the top right of the page changed to reflect the map’s name.

        .. image:: img/mapname1.png
           :alt: Save Map
        *Save Map*

        This link contains a permalink to your map. If you open this link in a new window, your map will appear exactly as it was saved.

4. Share your map
=================

Now let’s finish our map.

    #. Check the box next to the **highway** layer to activate it. If it is not below the **POI** layer in the list, click and drag it down.

        .. image:: img/maps_quickstart.png
           :width: 500px
           :alt: Activate Layers on Map
        *Activate Layers on Map*

    #. Make any final adjustments to the map composition as desired, including zoom and pan settings.

    #. Click the *Map* button in the toolbar, and then click *Publish Map*.

        .. image:: img/publishmaplink1.png
           :alt: Publish Map button
        *Publish Map button*

    #. The title and abstract as previously created should still be there. Make any adjustments as necessary, and click *Save*.

    #. A new dialog will appear with instructions on how to embed this map in a web page, including a code snippet. You can adjust the parameters as necessary.

        .. image:: img/publishmap1.png
           :alt: Publish the Map
        *Publish the Map*

Your map can now be shared!
