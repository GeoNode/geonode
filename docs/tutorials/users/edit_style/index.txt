Edit Layer Style
================

Editing a style can only be performed by users with the correct permissions.

1. In the Explore Layer page, choose a Layer that you want to edit by clicking on the name of the layer or in the preview window.
2. In the Edit Layers page, click the Edit Layer button.
3. In the Edit Layer window, click the Edit button under Style icon. In this interface is it possible to change the style of layers. GeoNode allows editing of layer styles graphically, without the need to resort to programming or requiring a technical background.

    In the following example, the layer has one style and one rule in that style. Click Edit in Styles menu, then change the Title and Abstract of the selected Style.

    Click the Rule (Untitled 1) to select it, and then click on *Edit* below it. 
    Edit the style by choosing the *Basic* tab to edit symbology of layers, the *Labels* tab to add and manage labels, and the *Advanced* tab to manage styles by scale and condition. 
    When done, click *Save*, then click on the word *Layers* to return to the layer list.

4. In the Edit Layer window, click the *Manage* button under the Style icon. The Manage Styles function allows assigning an available style to selected layers.

5. If you import a Style created by other GIS software (or edited directly in GeoServer), make sure that your .sld file already has the <Title></Title> and <Abstract></Abstract> nodes under the <UserStyle> node. Otherwise the style will be shown as "None" in GeoNode.
