Creating a map 
==============

Adding layers
-------------

#. Click the :guilabel:`Maps` link on the top toolbar. This will bring up the list of maps. 

   .. figure:: img/maps1.png

      *Maps page*

#. Currently, there aren't any maps here, so let's add one. Click the :guilabel:`Create a New Map` button.

#. A map composition interface will display. 

   .. figure:: img/createmap.png

      *Create maps interface*

   In this interface there is a toolbar, layer list, and map window. The map window contains the MapQuest OpenStreetMap layer by default. There are other service layers available here as well:  Blue Marble, Bing Aerial With Labels, MapQuest, and OpenStreetMap.

#. Click on the New Layers button and select Add Layers.

#. Select all of the San Andreas layers by clicking the top entry and Shift-clicking the bottom one. Click :guilabel:`Add Layers` to add them all to the map.

      *Selecting layers*

   .. note:: This selection includes not only the two layers uploaded in the previous section, but also the layers that were already hosted on GeoNode at the beginning of the workshop.

#. The layers will be added to the map. Click :guilabel:`Done` (right next to :guilabel:`Add Layers` at the bottom) to return to the main layers list.

Adding external layers
----------------------

#. Once again, click on the New Layers button and select Add Layers.

   .. figure:: img/addlayerslink.png

      *Add layers link*

#. From the top dropdown list, select :guilabel:`Add a New Server...`

   .. figure:: img/addnewserver.png

      *Add a New Server*

#. Enter the URL of the server, and select the correct type of server from the dropdown (WMS, TMS, or ArcGIS).  For example, enter `http://e-atlas.org.au/geoserver/wms` for the URL and select `Web Map Service` as the type.  Then click the :guilabel:`Add Server` button.

   .. figure:: img/serverurltype.png

      *New Server URL and Type*

#. Note - for security purposes, the URL you enter must be on a list of pre-approved external services set up by the GeoNode admininistrator.  Otherwise you will receive a 403 error when trying to add the server.

#. A list of layers available from that server should appear momentarily.  The layers must be available in the Web Mercator projection or they will not show up in the list.  Select the layers you want to add to the map.  Click :guilabel:`Add Layers` to add them all to the map.

   .. figure:: img/externallayersadd.png

      *Add layers*

#. The layers will be added to the map. Click :guilabel:`Done` (right next to :guilabel:`Add Layers` at the bottom) to return to the main layers list.

Saving the map
--------------

#. While we still have some work to do on our map, let's save it so that we can come back to it later. Click on the :guilabel:`Map` button in the toolbar, and select :guilabel:`Save Map`.

   .. figure:: img/savemaplink.png

      *Save map link*

#. Enter a title and abstract for your map.

   .. figure:: img/savemapdialog.png

      *Save map dialog*

#. Click :guilabel:`Save`. Notice that the link on the top right of the page changed to reflect the map's name.

   .. figure:: img/mapname.png

      *Saved map name*

   This link contains a permalink to your map. If you open this link in a new window, your map will appear exactly as it was saved.
