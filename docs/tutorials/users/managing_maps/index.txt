Managing maps
=============

The next primary component of GeoNode is the **map**. Maps are comprised of various layers and their styles. Layers can be both local layers in GeoNode as well as remote layers either served from other WMS servers or by web service layers such as Google or MapQuest.

GeoNode maps also contain other information such as map zoom and extent, layer ordering, and style.

In this section, we'll create a map based on the layers uploaded in the previous section, combine them with some existing layers and a remote web service layer, and then share the resulting map for public viewing.
