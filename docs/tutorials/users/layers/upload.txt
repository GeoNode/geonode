#. GeoNode has the ability to restrict who can view, edit, and manage layers. On the right side of the page, under :guilabel:`Who can view and download this data`, select :guilabel:`Any registered user`. This will ensure that anonymous view access is disabled.

#. In the same area, under :guilabel:`Who can edit this data`, select your username. This will ensure that only you are able to edit the data in the layer.
