Data management tools built into GeoNode allow for integrated creation of data, documents, link to external documents, and map visualizations. 
Each dataset in the system can be shared publicly or restricted to allow access to only specific users. 
Social features like user profiles and commenting and rating systems allow for the development of communities around each platform to facilitate the use, management, and quality control of the data the GeoNode instance contains.

Layers
------

Layers are a primary component of GeoNode.

Layers are publishable resources representing a raster or vector spatial data source. Layers also can be associated with metadata, ratings, and comments.

By clicking the Layers link you will get a list of all published layers. If logged in as an administrator, you will also see the unpublished layers in the same list.

      *Layers in GeoNode toolbar*

GeoNode allows the user to upload vector (currently only Shapefiles) and raster data in their original projections using a web form.

Vector data is uploaded in ESRI Shapefile format and satellite imagery and other kinds of raster data are uploaded as GeoTIFFs.

Maps
----

Maps are a primary component of GeoNode.

Maps are comprised of various layers and their styles. Layers can be both local layers in GeoNode as well as remote layers either served from other WMS servers or by web service layers such as Google or MapQuest.

GeoNode maps also contain other information such as map zoom and extent, layer ordering, and style.

By clicking the Map link you will get a list of all published maps.

      *Maps in GeoNode toolbar*

This toolbar allows you create a map based on the uploaded layers combine them with some existing layers and a remote web service layer, and then share the resulting map for public viewing. 
Once the data has been uploaded, GeoNode lets the user search for it geographically or via keywords and create maps. 
All the layers are automatically reprojected to web mercator for maps display, making it possible to use different popular base layers, like Open Street Map, Google Satellite or Bing layers.

Documents
---------

As for the layers and maps GeoNode allows to publish tabular and text data manage metadata and associated documents.

By clicking the Documents link you will be brought to the Documents menu where a new subtoolbar can be seen.
