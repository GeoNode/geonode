Editing - Modifying Layers
==========================

In GeoNode it is possible to visualize the data of a layer in a tabular format and search for specific values based on a simple search functionality.

It also possible to edit the non spatial attributes of each row or the location of a point (no line or polygon edit is supported).

Additionally you can add new features (points, lines, polygons) or you can delete features.

This is possible using the *edit_data* application.

Once the application is enabled in GeoNode you will be able to edit data of an empty layer by browsing to "Data > Layers > Select a Layer

> Editing Tools > Edit Data".

You will see a tabular form of the data like this:

.. figure:: img/edit_data_table.png

To add a new row click the button: Add a new entry.

To search for attributes in the table, use the search bar on the right.

To edit existing attributes (non spatial):

* click the button Edit Attributes
* edit each of the cell in the row and
* click save

To edit the location of a point, click Edit Geometry.

To delete a row, click the button: Delete Row
