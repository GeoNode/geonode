Managing layers
===============

After user accounts, the next primary component of GeoNode is the **layer**. Layers are a published resource representing a raster or vector spatial data source. Layers also can be associated with metadata, ratings, and comments.

In this section, you will learn how to create a new layer by uploading a local data set, add layer info, change the style of the layer, and share the results.
