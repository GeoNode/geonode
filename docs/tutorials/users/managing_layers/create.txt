Creating empty layers
=====================

In GeoNode it is possible to create empty layers, that can be populated with features at a later stage using the mapping client editing tools.

This is possible using the *createlayer* application, which can be enabled if GeoNode is installed with PostGIS.

Once the application is enabled in GeoNode you will be able to create an empty layer by browsing to "Data > Create Layer". You will see a form like this:

.. figure:: img/layer_create.png

Fill the form as needed:

* give a layer name
* give a layer title
* assign a geometry for the layer (Points, Lines, Polygons)
* add as many attributes as needed. For each attribute provide a name and a type. Type can be string, integer, float and date
* assign permissions as needed

Now by clicking the "Create" button your new empty layer should be created.
