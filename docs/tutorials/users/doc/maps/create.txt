Creating a map 
==============

Adding layers
-------------

#. Click the :guilabel:`Maps` link on the top toolbar. This will bring up the list of maps. 

   .. figure:: ../intro/img/maps.png

      *Maps page*

#. Currently, there aren't any maps here, so let's add one. Click the :guilabel:`Create a New Map` button.

#. A map composition interface will display.

      *Create maps interface*

   In this interface there is a toolbar, layer list, and map window. The map window contains the MapQuest OpenStreetMap layer by default. There are other service layers available here as well:  Blue Marble, Bing Aerial With Labels, MapQuest, and OpenStreetMap.

#. Click on the New Layers button and select Add Layers.

      *Selecting layers*

   .. note:: This selection includes not only the two layers uploaded in the previous section, but also the layers that were already hosted on GeoNode at the beginning of the workshop.

#. The layers will be added to the map. Click :guilabel:`Done` (right next to :guilabel:`Add Layers` at the bottom) to return to the main layers list.

Saving the map
--------------

#. While we still have some work to do on our map, let's save it so that we can come back to it later. Click on the :guilabel:`Map` button in the toolbar, and select :guilabel:`Save Map`.
