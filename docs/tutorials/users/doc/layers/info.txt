This page contains lots of options for managing this layer. Let's look at a few of them:

Downloads
---------

.. todo:: No option to edit data. Why not?

At the top of the page there are two buttons titled :guilabel:`Download Layer` and :guilabel:`Download Metadata`. These buttons provide access to the ability to extract geospatial data and metadata from within GeoNode. In this way, GeoNode allows for two way data access; one can import as well as export data.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Download Layer` button. You will see a list of options of the supported export formats.

   *Available export formats*

#. Click the option for :guilabel:`Zipped Shapefile`.

#. GeoNode will process the request and bring up a Save As dialog. Save this file to your computer, and note how it is the same content as was uploaded.

.. todo:: Wanted to show other format options, but all of them didn't really work all that well.

Metadata
--------

#. Scroll down the page toward the bottom. Five tabs are available: :guilabel:`Info`, :guilabel:`Attributes`, :guilabel:`Share`, :guilabel:`Ratings`, and :guilabel:`Comments`. The info tab is already highlighted, and presents basic information about the layer, of the kind that was seen on the layer list page.
