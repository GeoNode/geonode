Getting Started With Django
===========================

Object-relational mapper
========================
Data models can be defined entirely in Python. DJango makes available a rich, dynamic database-access API for free, but it is still possible to write SQL if needed.

.. hint:: The following documentation is based on official `documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en>`_ of the project Django.

.. note:: The following examples are taken from the official Django documentation for the sole purpose of introducing the general concepts.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    
    class Band(models.Model):
        """A model of a rock band."""
        name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        can_rock = models.BooleanField(default=True)


    class Member(models.Model):
        """A model of a rock band member."""
        name = models.CharField("Member's name", max_length=200)
        instrument = models.CharField(choices=(
                ('g', "Guitar"),
                ('b', "Bass"),
                ('d', "Drums"),
            ),
            max_length=1
        )
        band = models.ForeignKey("Band")
        
Models
------

A model is a Python class containing the essential fields and behaviors of the data stored on the DB. Generally, each model maps to a single database table.

* Each model is a Python class that subclasses ``django.db.models.Model``.
* Each attribute of the model represents a database field.
* A model is an automatically-generated database-access API; see :ref:`making_queries`.

Quick example
.............

.. note:: The following examples are taken from the official Django documentation for the sole purpose of introducing the general concepts.

This example model defines a ``Person``, which has a **first_name** and **last_name**:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    from django.db import models

    class Person(models.Model):
        first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
        last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)

**first_name** and **last_name** are fields of the model. Each field is specified as a class attribute, and each attribute maps to a database column.

The above ``Person`` model would create a database table like this:

.. code-block:: sql
    :linenos:
    
    CREATE TABLE myapp_person (
        "id" serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
        "first_name" varchar(30) NOT NULL,
        "last_name" varchar(30) NOT NULL
    );
    
Some technical notes:

* The name of the table, **myapp_person**, is automatically derived from some model metadata but can be overridden.
* An **id** field is added automatically, but this behavior can be overridden.
* The **CREATE TABLE** SQL in this example is formatted using PostgreSQL syntax, but it’s worth noting Django uses SQL tailored to the database backend specified in the settings file.

Using models
............

Once models have been defined, Django must be instructed on how to use those models. 
This is possible by editing the DJango settings file and changing the **INSTALLED_APPS** setting to add the name of the module that contains the **model class**.

For example, if the models for the application is defined in the module **myapp.models**, **INSTALLED_APPS** should read, in part:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        #...
        'myapp',
        #...
    )

.. warning:: When you add new apps to **INSTALLED_APPS**, be sure to run **manage.py migrate**, optionally making migrations for them first with **manage.py makemigrations**.

.. note:: GeoNode uses the specific command **manage.py syncdb** to perform the models update and migration.

Fields
......

The list of DB fields is reflected (and specified) by the model class attributes.

.. warning:: Be careful not to choose field names that conflict with the models API like **clean**, **save**, or **delete**.

Example:

.. note:: The following examples are taken from the official Django documentation for the sole purpose of introducing the general concepts.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    from django.db import models

    class Musician(models.Model):
        first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        last_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        instrument = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    class Album(models.Model):
        artist = models.ForeignKey(Musician)
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        release_date = models.DateField()
        num_stars = models.IntegerField()

Model methods
.............

Custom methods on a model can be used to add custom “row-level” functionality to an object.
This is a valuable technique for keeping business logic in one place.

For example, the following model has a few **custom methods**:

.. note:: The following examples are taken from the official Django documentation for the sole purpose of introducing the general concepts.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    from django.db import models

    class Person(models.Model):
        first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        last_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        birth_date = models.DateField()

        def baby_boomer_status(self):
            "Returns the person's baby-boomer status."
            import datetime
            if self.birth_date < datetime.date(1945, 8, 1):
                return "Pre-boomer"
            elif self.birth_date < datetime.date(1965, 1, 1):
                return "Baby boomer"
            else:
                return "Post-boomer"

        def _get_full_name(self):
            "Returns the person's full name."
            return '%s %s' % (self.first_name, self.last_name)
        full_name = property(_get_full_name)

The last method in this example is a `property <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/glossary/#term-property>`_.

The `model instance reference <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/models/instances/>`_ has a complete list of `methods automatically given to each model <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/models/instances/#model-instance-methods>`_.
It is possible to override most of these; see `overriding predefined model methods <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/db/models/#overriding-predefined-model-methods>`_

.. _making_queries:

`Making queries`_
-----------------

Django automatically gives a database-abstraction API that allows to create, retrieve, update and delete objects.

As an example:

.. note:: The following examples are taken from the official Django documentation for the sole purpose of introducing the general concepts.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    from django.db import models

    class Blog(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        tagline = models.TextField()

        def __str__(self):              # __unicode__ on Python 2
            return self.name

    class Author(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        email = models.EmailField()

        def __str__(self):              # __unicode__ on Python 2
            return self.name

    class Entry(models.Model):
        blog = models.ForeignKey(Blog)
        headline = models.CharField(max_length=255)
        body_text = models.TextField()
        pub_date = models.DateField()
        mod_date = models.DateField()
        authors = models.ManyToManyField(Author)
        n_comments = models.IntegerField()
        n_pingbacks = models.IntegerField()
        rating = models.IntegerField()

        def __str__(self):              # __unicode__ on Python 2
            return self.headline

Creating objects
................

As already said before, a model class represents a database table, and an instance of that class represents a particular record in the database table.

To create an object, instantiate it using keyword arguments to the model class, then call **save()** to save it to the database.

Assuming models live in a file **mysite/blog/models.py**, here’s an example:

.. note:: The following examples are taken from the official Django documentation for the sole purpose of introducing the general concepts.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    >>> from blog.models import Blog
    >>> b = Blog(name='Beatles Blog', tagline='All the latest Beatles news.')
    >>> b.save()

This performs an **INSERT SQL** statement behind the scenes. Django doesn’t hit the database until you explicitly call **save()**. 
The **save()** method has no return value.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    >>> b5.name = 'New name'
    >>> b5.save()

This performs an **UPDATE SQL** statement behind the scenes. Django doesn’t hit the database until you explicitly call **save()**.

Retrieving objects
..................

Retrieving objects from the database can be done by constructing a **QuerySet** via a **Manager** on the model class.

A **QuerySet** represents a collection of objects from the database. 
It can have zero, one or many filters. Filters narrow down the query results based on the given parameters.
In SQL terms, a **QuerySet** equates to a **SELECT** statement, and a filter is a limiting clause such as **WHERE** or **LIMIT**.

Each model has at least one **Manager**, and it’s called ``objects`` by default. 

It can be accessed directly via the model class, like so:

.. note:: The following examples are taken from the official Django documentation for the sole purpose of introducing the general concepts.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    >>> Blog.objects
    <django.db.models.manager.Manager object at ...>
    >>> b = Blog(name='Foo', tagline='Bar')
    >>> b.objects
    Traceback:
        ...
    AttributeError: "Manager isn't accessible via Blog instances."
    Note

**Managers** are accessible only via model classes, rather than from model instances, to *enforce a separation* between “table-level” operations and “record-level” operations.
The **Manager** is the main source of **QuerySets** for a model. For example, ``Blog.objects.all()`` returns a **QuerySet** that contains all Blog objects in the database.

The simplest way to retrieve objects from a table is to get all of them. To do this, use the **all()** method on a **Manager**:

.. note:: The following examples are taken from the official Django documentation for the sole purpose of introducing the general concepts.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    >>> all_entries = Entry.objects.all()

The **all()** method returns a **QuerySet** of all the objects in the database.
The **QuerySet** returned by **all()** describes all objects in the database table. 
To select only a subset of the complete set of objects, it must be refined by adding filter conditions. 

The two most common ways to refine a **QuerySet** are:

**filter(**kwargs)**

Returns a new **QuerySet** containing objects that match the given lookup parameters.

**exclude(**kwargs)**

Returns a new **QuerySet** containing objects that do not match the given lookup parameters.
The lookup parameters (****kwargs** in the above function definitions) should be in the format described in **Field** lookups below.

For example, to get a **QuerySet** of blog entries from the year 2006, use **filter()** like so:

.. note:: The following examples are taken from the official Django documentation for the sole purpose of introducing the general concepts.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    Entry.objects.filter(pub_date__year=2006)

With the default manager class, it is the same as:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    Entry.objects.all().filter(pub_date__year=2006)

The result of refining a **QuerySet** is itself a **QuerySet**, so it’s possible to chain refinements together. 

For example:

.. note:: The following examples are taken from the official Django documentation for the sole purpose of introducing the general concepts.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    >>> Entry.objects.filter(
    ...     headline__startswith='What'
    ... ).exclude(
    ...     pub_date__gte=datetime.date.today()
    ... ).filter(
    ...     pub_date__gte=datetime(2005, 1, 30)
    ... )

This takes the initial **QuerySet** of all entries in the database, adds a filter, then an exclusion, then another filter. 
The final result is a **QuerySet** containing all entries with a headline that starts with “What”, that were published between January 30, 2005, and the current day.

URLs and views
==============

A clean elegant URL scheme is an important detail in a high-quality Web application.
Django encourages beautiful URL design and does not put junk in URLs, like .php or .asp.

In DJango a Python module called URLconf is like a table of contents for the application.
It contains a simple mapping between URL patterns and the **views**.

.. note:: The following examples are taken from the official Django documentation for the sole purpose of introducing the general concepts.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    from django.conf.urls import url
    from . import views

    urlpatterns = [
        url(r'^bands/$', views.band_listing, name='band-list'),
        url(r'^bands/(\d+)/$', views.band_detail, name='band-detail'),
        url(r'^bands/search/$', views.band_search, name='band-search'),
    ]
      
.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    from django.shortcuts import render

    def band_listing(request):
        """A view of all bands."""
        bands = models.Band.objects.all()
        return render(request, 'bands/band_listing.html', {'bands': bands})

More: `URL dispatcher <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/http/urls/>`_

Templates
=========

Django’s template language allows developers to put logic into the HTML:

.. note:: The following examples are taken from the official Django documentation for the sole purpose of introducing the general concepts.

.. code-block:: html
    :linenos:

    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Band Listing</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>All Bands</h1>
        <ul>
        {% for band in bands %}
          <li>
            <h2><a href="{{ band.get_absolute_url }}">{{ band.name }}</a></h2>
            {% if band.can_rock %}<p>This band can rock!</p>{% endif %}
          </li>
        {% endfor %}
        </ul>
      </body>
    </html>
    
More: `Templates <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/templates/>`_

Forms
=====

Django provides a library that handles rendering HTML forms, validation of data submitted by users, and converting the data to native Python types. 
Django also provides a way to generate forms from your existing models and to use these forms to create and update data.

.. note:: The following examples are taken from the official Django documentation for the sole purpose of introducing the general concepts.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    from django import forms

    class BandContactForm(forms.Form):
        subject = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
        message = forms.CharField()
        sender = forms.EmailField()
        cc_myself = forms.BooleanField(required=False)
    
GET and POST
------------

**GET** and **POST** are the only HTTP methods to use when dealing with forms.

Django’s login form is returned using the **POST** method, in which the browser bundles up the form data, encodes it for transmission, sends it to the server, and then receives back its response.

**GET**, by contrast, bundles the submitted data into a string, and uses this to compose a URL. The URL contains the address where the data must be sent, as well as the data keys and values. 
You can see this in action if you do a search in the Django documentation, which will produce a URL of the form ``https://docs.djangoproject.com/search/?q=forms&release=1``.

**GET** and **POST** are typically used for different purposes.

Any request that could be used to change the state of the system - for example, a request that makes changes in the database - should use **POST**. **GET** should be used only for requests that do not affect the state of the system.

**GET** would also be unsuitable for a password form, because the password would appear in the URL, and thus, also in browser history and server logs, all in plain text. Neither would it be suitable for large quantities of data, or for binary data, such as an image. A Web application that uses **GET** requests for admin forms is a security risk: it can be easy for an attacker to mimic a form’s request to gain access to sensitive parts of the system. **POST**, coupled with other protections like Django’s CSRF protection offers more control over access.

On the other hand, **GET** is suitable for things like a web search form, because the URLs that represent a **GET** request can easily be bookmarked, shared, or resubmitted.

Authentication
==============

Django supports a full-featured and secure authentication system. It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions. 

.. note:: The following examples are taken from the official Django documentation for the sole purpose of introducing the general concepts.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
    from django.shortcuts import render

    @login_required
    def my_protected_view(request):
        """A view that can only be accessed by logged-in users"""
        return render(request, 'protected.html', {'current_user': request.user})

More: `User authentication in Django <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/auth/>`_
    
Admin
=====

One of the most powerful parts of Django is its automatic admin interface. 
It reads metadata from models in order to provide a powerful and ready-to-use GUI for **CRUD** operations against the model. 

.. note:: The following examples are taken from the official Django documentation for the sole purpose of introducing the general concepts.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    
    from django.contrib import admin
    from bands.models import Band, Member

    class MemberAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
        """Customize the look of the auto-generated admin for the Member model"""
        list_display = ('name', 'instrument')
        list_filter = ('band',)

    admin.site.register(Band)  # Use the default options
    admin.site.register(Member, MemberAdmin)  # Use the customized options

.. note:: The advanced workshop for Developers will provide more details on GeoNode specific models and admin interface

More: `The Django admin site <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/contrib/admin/>`_

Internationalization
====================

Django offers full support for translating text into different languages, plus locale-specific formatting of dates, times, numbers and time zones. 
It lets developers and template authors specify which parts of their apps should be translated or formatted for local languages and cultures, 
and it uses these hooks to localize Web applications for particular users according to their preferences.

.. note:: The following examples are taken from the official Django documentation for the sole purpose of introducing the general concepts.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    from django.shortcuts import render
    from django.utils.translation import ugettext

    def homepage(request):
        """
        Shows the homepage with a welcome message that is translated in the
        user's language.
        """
        message = ugettext('Welcome to our site!')
        return render(request, 'homepage.html', {'message': message})

.. code-block:: html
    :linenos:
    
    {% load i18n %}
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>{% trans 'Homepage - Hall of Fame' %}</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        {# Translated in the view: #}
        <h1>{{ message }}</h1>
        <p>
          {% blocktrans count member_count=bands.count %}
          Here is the only band in the hall of fame:
          {% plural %}
          Here are all the {{ member_count }} bands in the hall of fame:
          {% endblocktrans %}
        </p>
        <ul>
        {% for band in bands %}
          <li>
            <h2><a href="{{ band.get_absolute_url }}">{{ band.name }}</a></h2>
            {% if band.can_rock %}<p>{% trans 'This band can rock!' %}</p>{% endif %}
          </li>
        {% endfor %}
        </ul>
      </body>
    </html>

Security
========

Django provides multiple protections against:

* Clickjacking
    Clickjacking is a type of attack where a malicious site wraps another site in a frame. This attack can result in an unsuspecting user being tricked into performing unintended actions on the target site.
    
    The **X-Frame-Options middleware** contained in a form allow a supporting browser to prevent a site from being rendered inside a frame
    
* Cross site scripting (XSS)
    XSS attacks allow a user to inject client side scripts into the browsers of other users. This is usually achieved by storing the malicious scripts in the database where it will be retrieved and displayed to other users, or by getting users to click a link which will cause the attacker’s JavaScript to be executed by the user’s browser. However, XSS attacks can originate from any untrusted source of data, such as cookies or Web services, whenever the data is not sufficiently sanitized before including in a page.
    
* Cross site request forgery (CSRF)
    CSRF attacks allow a malicious user to execute actions using the credentials of another user without that user’s knowledge or consent.
    
    CSRF protection works by checking for a nonce in each POST request. This ensures that a malicious user cannot simply “replay” a form POST to your Web site and have another logged in user unwittingly submit that form. The malicious user would have to know the nonce, which is user specific (using a cookie).
    
* SQL injection
    SQL injection is a type of attack where a malicious user is able to execute arbitrary SQL code on a database. This can result in records being deleted or data leakage.
    
* Host header validation
    Django uses the **Host** header provided by the client to construct URLs in certain cases. 
    While these values are sanitized to prevent Cross Site Scripting attacks, a fake **Host** value can be used for Cross-Site Request Forgery, cache poisoning attacks, and poisoning links in emails.

    Because even seemingly-secure web server configurations are susceptible to fake **Host** headers, Django validates **Host** headers against the **ALLOWED_HOSTS** setting in the ``django.http.HttpRequest.get_host()`` method.

    This validation only applies via **get_host()**; if your code accesses the Host header directly from **request.META** you are bypassing this security protection.

* SSL/HTTPS
    It is always better for security, though not always practical in all cases, to deploy your site behind HTTPS. Without this, it is possible for malicious network users to sniff authentication credentials or any other information transferred between client and server, and in some cases – active network attackers – to alter data that is sent in either direction.
    
    Django provides some settings to secure your site unser SSL/HTTPS.

.. warning::
    While Django provides good security protection out of the box, it is still important to properly deploy your application and take advantage of the security protection of the Web server, operating system and other components.

    * Make sure that your Python code is outside of the Web server’s root. This will ensure that your Python code is not accidentally served as plain text (or accidentally executed).
    * Take care with any user uploaded files.
    * Django does not throttle requests to authenticate users. To protect against brute-force attacks against the authentication system, you may consider deploying a Django plugin or Web server module to throttle these requests.
    * Keep your **SECRET_KEY** a secret.
    * It is a good idea to limit the accessibility of your caching system and database using a firewall.
