Standards
=========

GeoNode is based on a set of Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards. These standards enable GeoNode installations to be interoperable with a wide variety of tools that support these OGC standards and enable federation with other OGC compliant services and infrastructure. Reference links about these standards are also included at the end of this module.

GeoNode is also based on Web Standards ...

Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Standards
------------------------------------------

Web Map Service (WMS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The Web Map Service (WMS) specification defines an interface for requesting rendered map images across the web. It is used within GeoNode to display maps in the pages of the site and in the GeoExplorer application to display rendered layers based on default or custom styles.

Web Feature Service (WFS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The Web Feature Service (WFS) specification defines an interface for reading and writing geographic features across the web. It is used within GeoNode to enable downloading of vector layers in various formats and within GeoExplorer to enable editing of Vector Layers that are stored in a GeoNode.

Web Coverage Service (WCS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The Web Coverage Service (WCS) specification defines an interface for reading and writing geospatial raster data as "coverages" across the web. It is used within GeoNode to enable downloading of raster layers in various formats.

Catalogue Service for Web (CSW)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The Catalogue Service for Web (CSW) specification defines an interface for exposing a catalogue of geospatial metadata across the web. It is used within GeoNode to enable any application to search GeoNode's catalogue or to provide federated search that includes a set of GeoNode layers within another application.

Tile Mapping Service (TMS/WMTS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The Tile Mapping Service (TMS) specification defines and interface for retrieving rendered map tiles over the web. It is used within geonode to enable serving of a cache of rendered layers to be included in GeoNode's web pages or within the GeoExplorer mapping application. Its purpose is to improve performance on the client vs asking the WMS for rendered images directly.

HTML
~~~~

    **HyperText Markup Language**, commonly referred to as **HTML**, is the
    standard markup language used to create web pages. [1]_ Web
    browsers can read HTML files and render them into visible or audible
    web pages. HTML describes the structure of a website semantically
    along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather
    than a programming language.

    HTML elements form the building blocks of all websites. HTML allows
    images and objects to be embedded and can be used to create
    interactive forms. It provides a means to create structured
    documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings,
    paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.

    The language is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of
    *tags* enclosed in angle brackets (like < >). Browsers do not display
    the HTML tags and scripts, but use them to interpret the content of the
    page.

    HTML can embed scripts written in languages such as JavaScript
    which affect the behavior of HTML web pages. Web browsers can also refer
    to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to define the look and layout of text
    and other material. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintainer
    of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS
    over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.

CSS
~~~

    **Cascading Style Sheets** (**CSS**) is a style sheet language used
    for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup
    language. [2]_ Although most often used to set the visual style of
    web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the
    language can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML,
    SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on
    other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone
    technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages,
    user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many
    mobile applications. [3]_

    CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content
    from document presentation, including aspects such as the layout,
    colors, and fonts. [4]_ This separation can improve content
    accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the
    specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML
    pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
    .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural
    content, such as semantically insignificant tables that were widely
    used to format pages before consistent CSS rendering was available in
    all major browsers. CSS makes it possible to separate presentation
    instructions from the HTML content in a separate file or style section
    of the HTML file. For each matching HTML element, it provides a list
    of formatting instructions. For example, a CSS rule might specify that
    “all heading 1 elements should be bold”, leaving pure semantic HTML
    markup that asserts “this text is a level 1 heading” without formatting
    code such as a ``<bold>`` tag indicating how such text should be
    displayed.

    This separation of formatting and content makes it possible to present
    the same markup page in different styles for different rendering
    methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (when read out by a
    speech-based browser or screen reader) and on Braille-based,
    tactile devices. It can also be used to display the web page differently
    depending on the screen size or device on which it is being viewed.

REST
~~~~ 

    In computing, **Representational State Transfer** (**REST**) is the
    software architectural style of the World Wide Web. [5]_ [6]_ [7]_
    REST gives a coordinated set of constraints to the design of components
    in a distributed hypermedia system that can lead to a higher
    performing and more maintainable architecture.

    To the extent that systems conform to the constraints of REST they can
    be called RESTful. RESTful systems typically, but not always,
    communicate over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol with the same HTTP
    verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) which web browsers use to
    retrieve web pages and to send data to remote servers. [8]_ REST
    interfaces usually involve collections of resources with
    identifiers, for example ``/people/tom``, which can be operated upon
    using standard verbs, such as ``DELETE /people/tom``.
