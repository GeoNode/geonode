Getting Help
============

Please use the GitHub project at https://github.com/boundlessgeo/gsimporter for any bug reports (and pull requests are welcome, but please include tests where possible.)

Running Tests
=============

The tests are integration tests. These require having a running GeoServer instance with the community/importer modules installed. Because some of the tests use a PostgreSQL database, a data base is required to run. **It is strongly advised to run with a data directory you don't care about.**

The test suite will first attempt to verify a connection to GeoServer and a connection to the database. If the default values are not appropriate, provide them via environment variables on the command line or via `export`. For example::

  GEOSERVER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 python setup.py test

A convenient way to deal with connection or other settings (besides setting things up to use the defaults) is to put them all in a bash (or other shell) script.

The tests are designed to create a workspace named `importer` and `importer2` for use in testing. `importer` will be set to the default workspace. As much as possible, things are cleaned up after test execution.

To run all of the tests, one way is via `setup.py`. `python setup.py test` should do the trick.

If developing and finer grained control is desired, specific tests and other flags can be provided using `python test/uploadtests.py`. Supported arguments are:

* **--clean** delete layers and stores in the test workspaces. Useful for cleanup.
* **--skip-teardown** don't delete things after running. May cause errors but useful for a single test.

To run a single case (or drop the method name to run the whole class)::

  python test/uploadtests.py ErrorTests.test_invalid_file
