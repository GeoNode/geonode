Python
======

We are looking for volunteers to flesh out this section with examples.

In the meantime, anyone looking to do python scripting of the GeoServer REST config API should use `gsconfig.py <https://github.com/dwins/gsconfig.py/wiki>`_. 
It is quite capable, and is used in production as part of `GeoNode <http://geonode.org>`_, so examples can be found in that codebase. 
Documentation and examples can be found at the section :ref:`geonode_lib_apis`.
