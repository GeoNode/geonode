Java
====

We are looking for volunteers to flesh out this section with examples.

In the meantime, anyone looking to do Java scripting of the GeoServer REST API should use `GeoServer Manager <https://github.com/geosolutions-it/geoserver-manager/wiki/>`_, a REST client library with minimal dependencies on external libraries.

Another option is `gsrcj <http://code.google.com/p/gsrcj/>`_.  This project is a GeoServer REST client written in Java with no extra dependencies on GeoServer/GeoTools, unlike the standard GeoServer REST module.  The project has minimal documentation, but does include a `Quickstart <http://code.google.com/p/gsrcj/wiki/Quickstart>`_.
