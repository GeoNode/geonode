REST API
========

Importer concepts
-----------------

The importer REST api is built around a tree of objects representing a single import, structured as follows:

   * import
      * target workspace
      * data
      * task (one or more)
          * data
          * layer
          * transformation (one or more)

An **import** refers to the top level object and is a "session" like entity the state of the entire import. It maintains information relevant to the import as a whole such as user infromation, timestamps 
along with optional information that is uniform along all tasks, such as a target workspace, the shared input data (e.g., a directory, a database).
An import is made of any number of task objects. 

A **data** is the description of the source data of a import (overall) or a task. In case the import has a global data definition, this normally refers to an aggregate
store such as a directory or a database, and the data associated to the tasks refers to a single element inside such aggregation, such as a single file or table.

A **task** represents a unit of work to the importer needed to register one new layer, or alter an existing one, and contains the following information:

* The data being imported
* The target store that is the destination of the import
* The target layer
* The data of a task, referred to as its source, is the data to be processed as part of the task. 
* The transformations that we need to apply to the data before it gets imported

This data comes in a variety of forms including:

* A spatial file (Shapefile, GeoTiff, KML, etc...)
* A directory of spatial files
* A table in a spatial database
* A remote location that the server will download data from

A task is classified as either "direct" or "indirect". A *direct task* is one in which the data being imported requires no transformation to be imported. 
It is imported directly. An example of such a task is one that involves simply importing an existing Shapefile as is. 
An *indirect task* is one that does require a **transformation** to the original import data. An example of an indirect task is one that involves importing a Shapefile into an existing PostGIS database. 
Another example of indirect task might involve taking a CSV file as an input, turning a x and y column into a Point, remapping a string column into a timestamp, and finally import the result into a PostGIS.

    GET /imports     

results in::

Creating a new import
"""""""""""""""""""""

Posting to the /imports path a import json object creates a new import session::

	Content-Type: application/json
	
	{
	   "import": {
	      "targetWorkspace": {
	         "workspace": {
	            "name": "scratch"
	         }
	      },
	      "targetStore": {
	         "dataStore": {
	            "name": "shapes"
	         }
	      },
	      "data": {
	        "type": "file",
	        "file": "/data/spearfish/archsites.shp"
	      }
	   }
	}

The parameters are:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 10 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Optional
     - Description
   * - targetWorkspace
     - Y
     - The target workspace to import to
   * - targetStore
     - Y
     - The target store to import to
   * - data
     - Y
     - The data to be imported

The mere creation does not start the import, but it may automatically populate its tasks depending on the target.
For example, by referring a directory of shapefiles to be importer, the creation will automatically fill in a task to import each of the shapefiles as a new layer.

The response to the above POST request will be::

	Status: 201 Created
	Location: http://localhost:8080/geoserver/rest/imports/2
	Content-Type: application/json
	
	{  
	  "import": {
	    "id": 2, 
	    "href": "http://localhost:8080/geoserver/rest/imports/2", 
	    "state": "READY", 
	    "targetWorkspace": {
	      "workspace": {
	        "name": "scratch"
	      }
	    }, 
	    "targetStore": {
	      "dataStore": {
	        "name": "shapes", 
	        "type": "PostGIS"
	      }
	    }, 
	    "data": {
	      "type": "file", 
	      "format": "Shapefile", 
	      "href": "http://localhost:8080/geoserver/rest/imports/2/data", 
	      "file": "archsites.shp"
	    }, 
	    "tasks": [
	      {
	        "id": 0, 
	        "href": "http://localhost:8080/geoserver/rest/imports/2/tasks/0", 
	        "state": "READY"
	      }
	    ]
	  }
	}
	
The operation of populating the tasks can require time, especially if done against a large set of
files, or against a "remote" data (more on this later), in this case the POST request can include ``?async=true``
at the end of the URL to make the importer run it asynchronously. 
In this case the import will be created in INIT state and will remain in such state until all
the data transfer and task creation operations are completed. In case of failure to fetch data
the import will immediately stop, the state will switch to the ``INIT_ERROR`` state,
and a error message will appear in the import context "message" field.

The representation of a import is the same as the one contained in the import creation response.
The execution of a import can be a long task, as such, it's possible to add ``async=true`` to the
request to make it run in a asynchronous fashion, the client will have to poll the import representation
and check when it reaches the "COMPLETE" state. 

Data
^^^^

A import can have a "data" representing the source of the data to be imported. The data can
be of different types, in particular, "file", "directory", "mosaic", "database" and "remote".
During the import initialization the importer will scan the contents of said resource, and
generate import tasks for each data found in it.

Most data types are discussed in the task section, the only type that's specific to the whole
import context is the "remote" one, that is used to ask the importer to fetch the data from
a remote location autonomusly, without asking the client to perform an upload.

The representation of a remote resource looks as follows::

      "data": {
        "type": "remote",
        "location": "ftp://fthost/path/to/importFile.zip",
        "username": "user",
        "password": "secret",
        "domain" : "mydomain"
      }

The location can be `any URI supported by Commons VFS <http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-vfs/filesystems.html>`_,
including HTTP and FTP servers. The ``username``, ``password`` and ``domain`` elements are all optional,
and required only if the remote server demands an authentication of sorts.
In case the referred file is compressed, it will be unpacked as the download completes, and the
tasks will be created over the result of unpacking.

	      "state": "READY"
	    }
	  ]
	}

Creating a new task as a file upload
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A new task can be created by issuing a POST to ``imports/<importId>/tasks`` as a "Content-type: multipart/form-data" multipart encoded data as defined by `RFC 2388 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2388.txt>`_.
One or more file can be uploaded this way, and a task will be created for importing them. In case the file being uploaded is a zip file, it will be unzipped on the server side and treated as a directory of files.

The response to the upload will be the creation of a new task, for example::

	Status: 201 Created
	Location: http://localhost:8080/geoserver/rest/imports/1/tasks/1
	Content-type: application/json
	
	{
	  "task": {

	    "state": "READY",
	    "updateMode": "CREATE", 
	    "data": {
	      "type": "file", 
	      "format": "Shapefile", 
	      "href": "http://localhost:8080/geoserver/rest/imports/2/tasks/1/data", 
	      "file": "bugsites.shp"
	    },

	        "type": "PostGIS"
	      }
	    },
	    "progress": "http://localhost:8080/geoserver/rest/imports/2/tasks/1/progress", 
	    "layer": {
	      "name": "bugsites",

	    }, 
	    "transformChain": {
	      "type": "vector", 
	      "transforms": []
	    }
	  }
	}

Creating a new task from form upload
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This creation mode assumes the POST to ``imports/<importId>/tasks`` of form url encoded data containing a ``url`` parameter::

	Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
	
	url=file:///data/spearfish/

The creation response will be the same as the multipart upload.

The representation of a task resource is the same one reported in the task creation response.

Updating a task
"""""""""""""""

A PUT request over an existing task can be used to update its representation. The representation can be partial, and just contains
the elements that need to be updated.

The updateMode of a task normally starts as "CREATE", that is, create the target resource if missing. Other possible values are
"REPLACE", that is, delete the existing features in the target layer and replace them with the task source ones, or "APPEND",
to just add the features from the task source into an existing layer.

The following PUT request updates a task from "CREATE" to "APPEND" mode::

	Content-Type: application/json
	
	{
	  "task": {
	     "updateMode": "APPEND"
	  }
	}

	}
	
Mosaic extensions
"""""""""""""""""

In case the input data is of ``mosaic`` type, we have all the attributes typical of a directory, plus support
for directly specifying the timestamp of a particular granule.

In order to specify the timestamp a PUT request can be issued against the granule::

	Content-Type: application/json
	
	{
	   "timestamp": "2004-01-01T00:00:00.000+0000"
	}

and the response will be::

	  "other": [], 
	  "timestamp": "2004-01-01T00:00:00.000+0000"
	}

Database data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following operations are specific to data objects of type ``database``. At the time or writing, the REST API does not allow
the creation of a database data source, but it can provide a read only description of one that has been created using the GUI.

/imports/<importId>/tasks/<taskId>/data

     - 200
     - n/a
     - List of database connection parameters and available tables

Performing a GET on a database type data will result in the following response::

		]
	}


Database table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following operations are specific to data objects of type ``table``. At the time or writing, the REST API does not allow
the creation of a database data source, but it can provide a read only description of one that has been created using the GUI.
A table description is normally linked to task, and refers to a database data linked to the overall import.

All the above attributes can be updated using a PUT request. Even if the above representation is similar to the REST config API, it should not
be confused with it, as it does not support all the same properties, in particular the supported properties are all the ones listed above.

     - A JSON transformation representation
     - The transform location 

Retrieving the transformation list
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A GET request for the list of transformations will result in the following response::

	Status: 200 OK
	Content-Type: application/json
	
	{
	  "transforms": [
	    {
	      "type": "ReprojectTransform", 
	      "href": "http://localhost:8080/geoserver/rest/imports/0/tasks/1/transforms/0", 
	      "source": null, 
	      "target": "EPSG:4326"
	    }, 
	    {
	      "type": "DateFormatTransform", 
	      "href": "http://localhost:8080/geoserver/rest/imports/0/tasks/1/transforms/1", 
	      "field": "date", 
	      "format": "yyyyMMdd"
	    }
	  ]
	}
	
Appending a new transformation
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Creating a new transformation requires posting a JSON document with a ``type`` property identifying the class of the
transformation, plus any extra attribute required by the transformation itself (this is transformation specific, each one will use a different set of attributes).

The following POST request creates an attribute type remapping::

	Content-Type: application/json
	
	{
	   "type": "AttributeRemapTransform",
	   "field": "cat",
	   "target": "java.lang.Integer"
	}
	
The response will be::

    Status: 201 OK
    Location: http://localhost:8080/geoserver/rest/imports/0/tasks/1/transform/2
    
/imports/<importId>/tasks/<taskId>/transforms/<transformId>

Retrieve a single transformation
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Requesting a single transformation by identifier will result in the following response::

	Status: 200 OK
	Content-Type: application/json
	
	{
	  "type": "ReprojectTransform", 
	  "href": "http://localhost:8080/geoserver/rest/imports/0/tasks/1/transforms/0", 
	  "source": null, 
	  "target": "EPSG:4326"
	}
	
Modify an existing transformation
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Assuming we have a reprojection transformation, and that we need to change the target SRS type, the following PUT request will do the job::

	Content-Type: application/json
	{
	   "type": "ReprojectTransform",
	   "target": "EPSG:3005"
	}
	
The response will be::

    Status: 200 OK
	Content-Type: application/json
	
	{
	  "type": "ReprojectTransform", 
	  "href": "http://localhost:8080/geoserver/rest/imports/0/tasks/1/transform/0",
