Using the Importer extension
============================

Here are step-by-step instructions to import multiple shapefiles in one operation. For more details on different types of operations, please see the :ref:`extensions_importer_guireference`

#. Find a directory of shapefiles and copy into your :ref:`data_directory`.

   .. note:: You can always use the `Natural Earth Quickstart <http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/>`_ data for this task.

#. Log in as an administrator and navigate to the :guilabel:`Data --> Import Data` page.

#. For select :guilabel:`Spatial Files` as the data source.

#. Click :guilabel:`Browse` to navigate to the directory of shapefiles to be imported.

#. The web-based file browser will show as options your home directory, data directory, and the root of your file system (or drive). In this case, select :guilabel:`Data directory`

#. Back on the main form, select :guilabel:`Create new` next to :guilabel:`Workspace`, and enter :kbd:`ne` to denote the workspace.

   .. note:: Make sure the :guilabel:`Store` field reads :guilabel:`Create new` as well.

#. In most cases, all files will be ready for import, but if the the spatial reference system (SRS) is not recognized, you will need to manually input this but clicking :guilabel:`Advanced`

   .. note:: You will need to manually input the SRS if you used the Natural Earth data above. For each layer click on :guilabel:`Advanced` and set reprojection to :kbd:`EPSG:4326`.
