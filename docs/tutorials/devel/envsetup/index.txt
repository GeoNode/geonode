Pavement.py and Paver
=====================

`Paver <http://pythonhosted.org/Paver/>`_ is a python module that automates repetitive tasks like running documentation generators, moving files around,
testing and downloading things using the convenience of Python’s syntax and massive library of code.  GeoNode comes with several
paver tasks which save administrators and developers from having to manually perform repetitive operations from the command line.
The tasks are stored in the pavement.py file in your GeoNode root directory and can be run with ```paver <task_name>``` from that directory.
