GeoNode debugging techniques
============================

GeoNode can be difficult to debug as there are several different components
involved:

* Browser - includes HTML/CSS issues, JavaScript, etc.
* Django - GeoNode HTML views and web APIs
* GeoServer - Core Wxx services and Platform REST APIs

When attempting to diagnose a specific problem, often the order of investigation
mirrors the order above - that is, start with the client: Is this a bug in code
running on the browser. If not, step to the next level: the Django responses to
client requests. Often this is possible via the browser using the correct tools.
Many requests require Django communications with GeoServer. This is the next
stage of investigation if a specific bug does not appear to originate in Django
or the client.

The following section covers techniques to help diagnose and debug errors.
