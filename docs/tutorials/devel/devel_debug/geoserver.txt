Debugging GeoServer
===================

Resources:

- http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/production/troubleshooting.html
- http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/production/troubleshooting.html

This section does not attempt to cover developer-level debugging in GeoServer as
this is a much larger topic involving many more tools. The goal here is to
provide 'black-box' techniques to help resolve and report problems.

Logging
-------

GeoServer logging, while sometimes containing too much information, is the best
way to start diagnosing an issue in GeoNode once the other. To create a proper
error report for use in requesting support, providing any contextual logging
information is critical.

When using a standard GeoServer installation, the GeoServer logs are located at
:file:`/usr/share/geoserver/data/logs/geoserver.log`. The properties files that
control the varying rules are also located here.

Exercises
..........

#. Switch logging levels for various loggers.
#. Look at the different logging profiles and discuss the loggers and levels.
#. Learn how to read stack traces, nested or otherwise.

Advanced Troubleshooting
------------------------

JVM diagnostics and advanced troubleshooting techniques are covered in the
GeoServer documents linked to above. When providing information for a bug
report, these can be helpful but in-depth Java knowledge is required to fully
comprehend the output from some of these tools.

Exercises
..........

#. Look at jstack output

Using Django to Help Debug
--------------------------

The gsconfig library provides a rich interface to interacting with GeoServer's
REST API. This allows high-level functions as well as viewing raw REST responses.

  .. code-block:: python

     cat = Layer.objects.gs_catalog
     cat.get_layers() # list of gsconfig layer objects
     # OR, for a specific layer
     lyr = Layer.objects.get(id=1)
     lyr.resource # specific gsconfig layer object
     lyr.resource.fetch() # get the XML from REST
     lyr.resource.dom # reference to the parsed XML
     from xml.etree.ElementTree import tostring
     tostring(lyr.resource.dom)
