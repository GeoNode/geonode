Customized GeoNode Projects
===========================

This module will teach you about how to set up and customize your own GeoNode-based project by changing the theme, adding additional modules, and integrating with other systems. When complete, you should understand how Downstream GeoNode projects work, and how to set up a project of your own.

.. todo:: Unclear capitalization in places. For example, is "Downstream" a thing? I removed lots of capitalizations in places where I didn't think it was necessary. Please review.

.. todo:: You set up something. When you're done, you have a setup. Different things.

.. todo:: Images desperately need some kind of border around them to keep them separate from the text, and also the ability to be automatically resized. When everything has a white background, impossible to tell where images end and text begins.

.. todo:: Encased files with :file:`path/to/file` to allow for separate (monospaced) rendering.

.. todo:: Code blocks render nicer when using "code-block", even for shell commands. I added this in in most places.

.. todo:: Figures are much more helpful when they have captions. Please add them where they are missing.

.. todo:: Suggest using second-person ("Now you open the...") instead of "let's" (Now let's open the...) or even "we". I changed this in some but not every place.
