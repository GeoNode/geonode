Bookmarking and embedding your map in another web page
======================================================

In addition to being able to save changes to your map, it is also possible to embed your map in other web pages.  This will provide a live view of your map within a blog or any web page.

Create a view that you like and want to show to someone else.  Then click the *Publish Map* button at the upper left.

Now you have an embed tag that you can paste into a blog or an HTML page.

Open a blog or page if you have one.  If you don’t have one and would like to try this, go to `blogspot.com <http://blogspot.com>`_ and create a blog.
Open a blog entry then paste the snippet into the blog and save it.

.. note:: Make sure you are in HTML edit mode when you paste the snippet.


Now view it.  See that panning and zooming is supported.

You can change the size of the embedded map by using the pulldown to change the height and width of the embedded map (measured in pixels), or by editing the height and width parameters in the code snippet manually.
