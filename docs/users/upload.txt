Creating styles with desktop software
=====================================

You can create styles using desktop tools such as `AtlasStyler <http://en.geopublishing.org/AtlasStyler>`_.  This application is currently somewhat limited but you may find it does what you need.

There is also a tool which runs in ArcGIS 9.3 called `ArcMap2SLD <http://wald.intevation.org/projects/arcmap2sld/>`_. This approach allows you to take advantage of much of the symbolization power of ArcGIS and apply it to GeoNode. The adaptation of this tool to ArcGIS 10 is a work in progress.

We will not use AtlasStyler or ArcMap2SLD now but an optional challenge exercise for this is included at the end.


Uploading shapefile with associated style
=========================================

Navigate back to the GeoNode home page and click the *Upload Data* link.

When you come to the *Upload Layer* page you will see these areas (* items are required).

***Title:**  Give your layer a title.

***Data:**  Choose a Shapefile (.shp parts) or GeoTIFF as your data to load.  

.. note:: You will increase your chances of a successful upload by having your shapefile or GeoTIFF file be in the “plain vanilla” projection space, Geographic WGS 84, also known as EPSG:4326.  To know whether your shapefile is in this space, the contents of your .prj file will look like this in a text editor: ``GEOGCS["GCS_WGS_1984",DATUM["D_WGS_1984", SPHEROID["WGS_1984",6378137.0, 298.257223563]], PRIMEM["Greenwich",0.0], UNIT["Degree",0.0174532925199433]]``

You may not have a .prj file for your GeoTIFF as it is not needed since the projection information for a GeoTIFF is stored in the header of the GeoTIFF.

If your .prj file does not look like this, the upload may still work fine.  If it doesn’t, the most likely culprit is the projection space.  The best way to fix that is to use an application like ArcGIS or QGIS and reproject your file to Geographic WGS 84.  This can be done for shapefiles or GeoTIFF files.

**SLD:**  Optionally provide an SLD.  This is an XML document that you would have created using the *AtlasStyler* or the *ArcMap2SLD* tool.

***Abstract:**  Provide a description of your data. More information is better.  At the very least when you add real data, please include a brief description of the data, who created it, for what purpose, and when.  Please also include source materials used to create the data layer.  This information is important both for you to remember what the data is about, and to allow someone else a chance to benefit from your work (assuming you want to make the data available for others to use at some point).

**Permissions:**  Default permissions are set such that the world can view it but only you can change it.  Add individual users to define who can edit (modify the style), or manage (delete layer, change permission settings).  

If you select a GeoTIFF file for the Data item above, the view will remain the same.  If you choose a shapefile, (the part of the shapefile with the “.shp” ending), the view will change to handle the additional parts of the shapefile as shown below as well as an optional encoding selection:  

* **Data:**  Choose the .shp portion of the shapefile
* **DBF:**  Choose the .dbf portion of the shapefile
* **SHX:**  Choose the .shx portion of the shapefile
* **PRJ:**  Choose the .prj portion of the shapefile

Click *Upload* and once uploaded you will be presented with a metadata form (see below).

Metadata
--------

.. note:: Users uploading new layers are prompted to fill in optional and required descriptive information about the layer.  Required items include: Title, Abstract, Keyword, thematic category (ISO 19115 format).  Eventually Author, Source, and Date will be included as options in the metadata editor. 

Once the file has been uploaded, the only additional required items are Keyword and Category, though there are useful metadata fields here which we strongly encourage you to make use of.  Starred items are required.

***Title -** Provide a title for your dataset.  We recommend using the following naming convention:

``<geography - continent, country, state, or city>_<what it is>_<date data represents>_<optional version>_<optional temp if it is for testing purposes and can be removed after a week>``

Example: 
``africa_ethnographic_1959_2_temp``

**Date -** This date is filled in automatically with the date of upload, but can be changed.

**Date Type -** (creation/publication/revision) Choose type of date you want to describe. The default type is *creation*.

**Edition -**  Use this field to describe the edition.

**Abstract -**  Give an overview of the dataset. What does the data represent? Who created it and when? What sources were used? 

**Purpose -**  Describe briefly how the data can be used.

**Maintenance Frequency -**  How often is the data updated?

**Keywords -**  Add keywords that will be useful handles others can use to find the dataset.  Separate keywords with a space.

**Keywords Region -** Select a major region of the world.  Other regions in addition to countries will be added.

**Constraints Use -** What are the rules governing the use of this data?  

**Constraints Other -**  Include any additional constraints.

**Spatial Representation Type -** 

* **grid –** raster dataset such as georeferenced satellite image or scanned georeferenced map in GeoTIFF format.
* **steroModel –** currently not supported unless stored in a GeoTIFF or Shapefile format
* **textTable -** currently not supported unless stored in a GeoTIFF or Shapefile format
* **tin -** currently not supported unless stored in a GeoTIFF or Shapefile format
* **vector –** point, line, or polygon dataset in ESRI Shapefile format.

**Language -**  Please choose the language closest to the language used in the attribute table if the dataset is a Shapefile and for the language used on the map if the dataset is a GeoTIFF.

**Temporal Extent End -** Use an end date if the data in your layer is best presented by a date range.

**Geographic Bounding Box -**  This describes the theoretical box necessary to enclose the data geographically and is automatically calculated by the system.  It can also be modified here.  The projection system used to define the bounding box is also defined here.

**Supplemental Information -**   Additional information about your data.

**Distribution URL -**  This URL is calculated by the system.  This URL displays this data layer along with information about it and is a possible form of citation.

**Data Quality Statement -**  Add any information you have describing data quality.

**Point of Contact -**  Person who  should be contacted with questions about the data.

**Metadata Author -**  Name of the person who created the metadata. 


Troubleshooting shapefile uploading
===================================

If the layer does not upload there are several possible reasons why:

* The projection is not being read properly.  If the layer is not already in Geographic WGS 84 space, also known as EPSG 4326, project the shapefile to that space and try again.
* The SLD file is not correct. Check to see that the `XML is valid <http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input>`_  
* Check to see that the SLD file was created for this shapefile and not another shapefile.  The fields described in the SLD should match the fields in the shapefile.

If all else fails, project your file to Geographic WGS 84 and don’t include any SLD.


Uploading GeoTIFF
=================

Raster files are images and can be satellite imagery or scanned maps which have been georeferenced.  GeoTIFF files are rasters and have all the necessary information for display and georeferencing in one file.

Return to the *Upload Data* page.  Now give it a title and choose the *elevation.tif* file to upload. Provide abstract information and click *Upload*.  

Raster (GeoTIFF) images do not have the same type of styling options as vector (shapefile) layers do. 


Permissions
===========

Users can control whether others can see and/or modify the layers they load to their Map. Layer permissions can be set at the time of upload and can be modified as needed later.  

.. note:: Currently any uploaded layer which can be viewed by the public is also technically downloadable even though it may appear not to be.  There do exist some custom layers in GeoNode which reside on a separate server and can be viewed but not downloaded, but the ability to make layers viewable but not downloadable is not yet enabled in the GeoNode interface.


Adding your new layers to a map
===============================

Go to the information page for your newly uploaded layer.

To find it, go back to the GeoNode home page, and type the title of your layer into the search field under *Data*.  Click the search button to go to a list of the available data on GeoNode, filtered by your search keywords.

Now click the *Create a map* link in the right hand sidebar.  This will take you to the *Map Composer* with the suitability layer added already.
