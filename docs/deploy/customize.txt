Customizing the look and feel of GeoNode
========================================

This section will explain how to change GeoNode's main logo, the index page and the colors.
It also contains an introduction to Django's template and media management.

The paths to the different locations are assumed to be on Ubuntu with GeoNode installed via packages, but the same notions can be applied in any deployment.

Customizing the home page
=========================

GeoNode uses Django's template engine, :file:`/etc/geonode/templates` is empty by default but it is abover other folders in the template lookup hierarchy.
This means that it is possible to copy any html template to that location and it will take precence.
Let's start by doing the following::

    sudo cp /var/lib/geonode/src/GeoNodePy/geonode/templates/index.html /etc/geonode/templates

The copy of :file:`index.html` that was just created takes precedence over the default one, the text in the main section can be changed there and a reload of the web page in the browser will show the updated version.

.. note:: Changes to templates are picked up automatically and do not require a server restart.

With the same approach, the structure of all pages can be modified by copying and then editing ``page_template.html``. We recommend reading about the `Django template language`_ for advanced customizations.

.. _Django template language: http://docs.djangoproject.com/

.. note:: While editing the templates in place will also achieve the expected results, it will make upgrading GeoNode harder, therefore it is recommended to follow the approach described above.


Changing the default logo
=========================

Similarly to the way the templates work, GeoNode's images and css files can be overriden in :file:`/etc/geonode/media`.

The original GeoNode logo is located at :file:`/var/lib/geonode/src/GeoNode/geonode/media/theme/img/logo-bg.png`.
Make a copy and edit it using Photoshop, GIMP, or your preferred image editor and then save it in :file:`/etc/geonode/media/theme/img/logo-bg.png`.

Once the logo is placed there, it is neccessary to run the media collection command::

    sudo geonode collectstatic -v0

This will gather all the media in the diferent locations (both source and the user customizations) and put it in the directory being served by apache: :file:`/var/www/geonode/static/`.

.. note:: It is not recommended to change the files directly in :file:`/var/www/geonode/static/` because they are overwritten any time the media collaction command is run.


Changing the entire site media
==============================

All the files in :file:`/var/lib/geonode/src/GeoNodePy/geonode/media/theme` can be overriden using this method, including :file:`css/base.css` which contains most of the color schemes for the entire site.
