Configuring GeoNode for Production
==================================

This page documents recommendations for configuring GeoNode in production environments.
The steps mentioned in the first section are required to run GeoNode, the ones in the second section are either optional or ways to get more performance.

.. note:: This document makes numerous references to the **<host>** variable, please replace it with the IP Address of your GeoNode or the DNS.
          For example: instead of ``http://<host>/geoserver``, write down: ``http://mygeonode.com/geoserver`` or ``http://127.0.0.1/geoserver``

Required steps
==============

Creating a super user
---------------------

To create a superuser you can run::

    geonode createsuperuser

or, if you installed by source::

    source path/to/geonode/virtualenv/bin/activate
    django-admin.py createsuperuser --settings=geonode.settings

Once your user is created, you can navigate to your site using the IP address and log in. But don't forget to change the SITEURL as explained in the next step before uploading data.

Configuring the correct DNS or IP address
-----------------------------------------

By default GeoNode runs in ``http://localhost/``, but when running in production in needs to know the public IP address or the DNS entry.
To configure it, edit the ``SITEURL`` setting in ``local_settings.py`` (which can be found either in your GeoNodePy/src/geonode folder or in ``/etc/geonode/local_settings.py`` if you used an automated installer, for example::

    SITEURL='http://127.0.0.1/'

Once that it is changed you have to re-start the apache server::

    sudo service apache2 restart

.. warning:: Don't forget the trailing slash, because it is used to construct the ``GEOSERVER_BASE_URL`` param.


Set the correct GeoServer Proxy URL value
---------------------------------------------

Navigate to ``http://localhost/geoserver``, log in and click on ``Settings/Global`` and look for the ``Proxy Base URL`` text field, put the complete address there::

    http://<host>/geoserver/

Configure the Printing Module
-----------------------------

This lives in the GeoServer Data dir ``/var/lib/geoserver/geonode-data/printing/config.yaml``, add your server's IP address or domain name to the list of exceptions::

    hosts:
      - !dnsMatch
        host: YOUR_IP_ADDRESS
        port: 80


Recommended Steps (optional)
============================

Adding layers from Google, Bing and other providers
---------------------------------------------------

Bing
++++

Get an API key from Microsoft at http://bingmapsportal.com/ and place it in ``local_settings.py``. Add the following to ``MAP_BASELAYERS``::

    },{
    "source": {
               "ptype":"gxp_bingsource",    
               "apiKey": "YOUR_BING_API"
              },
    "group":"background",
    "name":"Aerial",
    "visibility": False,
    "fixed": True,



Google
++++++

Get an API key from Google at http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html and place it in ``local_settings.py``, for example::

    GOOGLE_API_KEY="zxcxzcXAWdqwdQWWQEDzxcxz"

Copy the ``MAP_BASELAYERS`` dictionary from ``settings.py`` into ``local_settings.py`` and add the following snippet::

    },{
    "source": {
         "ptype":"gxp_googlesource",	
         "apiKey": GOOGLE_API_KEY
        },
    "group":"background",
    "name":"SATELLITE",
    "visibility": False,
    "fixed": True,


Sitemaps Configuration
----------------------

GeoNode can automatically generate a sitemap suitable for submission to search
engines which can help them to index your GeoNode site more efficiently and 
effectively.

In order to generate the sitemap properly, the sites domain name must be set
within the sites framework. This requires that an admin user login to the
admin interface and navigate to the sites module and change example.com to the
actual domain name (and port if applicable). The admin interface can be accessed
at http://<host>/admin/sites/site/

It is possible to 'inform' google of changes to your sitemap. This is accomplished
using the ping_google management command. More information can be found here
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/sitemaps/#django.contrib.sitemaps.ping_google
It is recommended to put this call into a cron (scheduled) job to update google periodically.


Configuring User Registration
-----------------------------

You can optionally configure GeoNode to allow new users to register through the web.  New registrants will be sent an email inviting them to activate their account.

To allow new user registration:

1. Set up the email backend for Django (see `Django documentation <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/email/#e-mail-backends>`_) and add the appropriate settings to ``./src/GeoNodePy/geonode/settings.py``.  For example::

       EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
       EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
       EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'foo@gmail.com'
       EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'bar'
       EMAIL_PORT = 587
       EMAIL_USE_TLS = True

2. One week activation window::

       ACCOUNT_ACTIVATION_DAYS = 7 
       
3. In the same settings file set::

       REGISTRATION_OPEN=True   

4. With the Django application running, set the domain name of the service properly through the admin interface.  (This domain name is used in the account activation emails.)::

       http://<host>/admin/sites/site/1

To register as a new user, click the ''Register'' link in the GeoNode index header.

Additional Configuration
------------------------

Some other things that require tweaking:

* Web-accessible uploads directory for user profile photos

* Configuring GeoNetwork/Django to use a "real" Postgres database instead of
  embedded ones.

* In order to generate the sitemap properly, the sites domain name must be set
  within the sites framework. This requires that an admin user login to the
  admin interface and navigate to the sites module and change example.com to the
  actual domain name (and port if applicable). The admin interface can be accessed
  at http://<host>/admin/sites/site/


Robot Exclusion File
--------------------

GeoNode has several views that require considerable resources to properly respond - for example, the download links on layer detail pages require GeoServer to dynamically generate output in PDF, PNG, etc. format.
Crawlers for web search engines such as Google may cause problems by quickly following many such links in succession.
In order to request that "robots" do not make requests directly to GeoServer, you can ensure that requests to ``/robots.txt`` return a text file with the following content::

    User-agent: *
    Disallow: /geoserver/
    Disallow: /geoserver-geonode-dev/
    Disallow: /geonetwork/

This will only affect automated web agents; web browsers in particular are unaffected.


Memory Management
-----------------

At the time of the GeoNode 1.0 release, the GeoNode manual recommended at least 4GB RAM for servers running GeoNode.
While 4GB *physical* RAM is sufficient, it is recommended that machines be configured with at least 6GB total *virtual* memory.
For example, a machine with 4GB physical RAM and 2GB swap space should be able to run GeoNode, but if you would like to run without a swapfile then you should configure the machine with at least 6GB RAM.

On Linux and MacOSX hosts, you can check the available RAM with the following command::

    $ free -m
                 total         used       free     shared    buffers     cached
    Mem:          6096         3863       2232          0          0          0
    -/+ buffers/cache:         3863       2232
    Swap:            0            0          0

The "total" column lists the available physical memory and swap space in megabytes; adding them together yields the amount of virtual memory available to the system.
In this example, there is no Swap space so that field is 0 and the available RAM on the system is 6096MB (6 GB). 


Configuring the Servlet Container
---------------------------------

GeoServer is the most resource intensive component of GeoNode.
There are some general notes on setting up GeoServer for production environments in the `GeoServer manual <http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/production/index.html>`_ .
However, the following are some GeoServer recommendations with GeoNode's specific needs in mind.


JVM Options
-----------

The JRE used with GeoNode should be that distributed by Oracle.
Others such as OpenJDK may work but Oracle's JRE is recommended for higher performance rendering.

Startup options should include the following::

    -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -XX:MaxPermSize=256M \
        -XX:CompileCommand=exclude,net/sf/saxon/event/ReceivingContentHandler.startEvent

These can be specified using the ``CATALINA_OPTS`` variable in Tomcat's ``bin/catalina.sh`` file, or the ``JETTY_OPTS`` in Jetty's ``bin/jetty.sh`` file.


Constrain GeoServer Worker Threads
----------------------------------

While the JVM provides memory management for most operations in Java applications, the memory used for rendering (in GeoServer's case, responding to WMS GetMap requests) is not managed this way, so it is allocated in addition to the memory permitted by the JVM options above.
If GeoServer receives many concurrent requests, it may increase the memory usage significantly, so it is recommended to constrain the number of concurrent requests at the servlet container (ie, Jetty or Tomcat).

.. highlight:: xml

For Tomcat, you can edit ``conf/server.xml``.  By default, this file contains an entry defining a ContextHandler::

    <Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1" 
        connectionTimeout="20000" 
        redirectPort="8443"/>

Add a ``maxThreads`` attribute to limit the number of threads (concurrent requests) to 50 (the default in Tomcat is 200)::

    <Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1" 
        connectionTimeout="20000" 
        redirectPort="8443" maxThreads="50"/>

.. note:: This configuration is possible in Jetty as well but not yet documented in this manual.


Native JAI and JAI ImageIO
--------------------------

Using the native-code implementation of JAI and JAI ImageIO speeds up GeoServer, thereby requiring less concurrency at the same level of throughput.
The GeoServer manual contains `platform-specific instructions <http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/production/java.html#install-native-jai-and-jai-image-i-o-extensions>`_ for configuring JAI and JAI ImageIO.


GeoServer Configuration
=======================

There are a few controls to be set in the GeoServer configuration itself as well.


On the JAI Settings page
------------------------

.. figure:: GeoServer-JAI-Settings.png

   There are two considerations for the JAI settings.
   
      * Enable JPEG and PNG Native Acceleration to speed up the performance of WMS requests

      * Disable Tile Recycling as this optimization is less relevant on recent JVM implementations and has some overhead itself.


On the WMS Service page
-----------------------

.. figure:: GeoServer-Web-Map-Service.png

   There is only one consideration for the Web Map Service page

     * Don't set the "Resource Consumption Limits."
       This sounds a bit counterintuitive, but these limits are implemented in an inefficient way such that unless resource-intensive requests are common on your server it is more efficient to avoid the limits.
       A better implementation of this feature is available for GeoServer 2.1 and will be incorporated in GeoNode 1.1.


Printing with the Mapfish Print Service
=======================================

The GeoNode map composer can "print" maps to PDF documents using the `Mapfish
print service <http://www.mapfish.org/doc/print>`_.  The recommended way to run
this service is by using the printing extension to GeoServer (if you are using
the pre-built GeoNode package, this extension is already installed for you).
However, the print service includes restrictions on the servers that can
provide map tiles for printed maps.  These restrictions have a fairly strict
default, so you may want to loosen these constraints.

Adding servers by hostname
..........................

.. highlight:: yaml

The Mapfish printing module is configured through a `YAML <yaml>`_
configuration file, usually named :file:`print.yaml`.  If you are using the
GeoServer plugin to run the printing module, this configuration file can be
found at :file:`{GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR}/printing/config.yaml`.  The default
configuration should contain an entry like so::

    hosts:
      - !dnsMatch
        host: labs.metacarta.com
        port: 80
      - !dnsMatch
        host: terraservice.net
        port: 80

You can add host/port entries to this list to allow other servers.
