Debugging GeoNode installations
===============================

There are several mechanisms to debug GeoNode installations, the most common ones are discussed in the following sections.

Viewing the logs
================

There are many kinds of logs in GeoNode, most of them are located in :file:`/var/log/geonode/` and will be explained below in order of relevance:

 * **GeoNode main log**: This is the output of the Django aplication coming from Apache, it may contain detailed information about uploads and high level problems.
   The default location is :file:`/var/log/geonode/apache.log` or :file:`/var/log/apache2/error.log`.
   It is set to a very low level by default, but it's output can be increased by setting the logging level to ``DEBUG`` in :file:/etc/geonode/local_settings.py.

 * **GeoServer log**: It contains most of the information related to problems with data, rendering and styling errors.
   This one can be accessed at ``GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR/logs/geoserver.log``, which is usually :file:`/var/lib/geoserver/geonode-data/logs/geoserver.log``.
   It may also be symlinked in :file:`/var/log/geonode/geoserver.log`.

 * **Geonetwork log**: Contains information about CSW and metadata handling.
   Records related to bad html parsing could be further identified by analyzing GeoNetwork logs.
   It is symlinked in :file:`/var/log/geonode/geonetwork.log` and originally in :file:`/var/lib/tomcat6/logs/geonetwork.log`.

 * **Tomcat logs**: Tomcat logs could indicate problems loading GeoServer or GeoNetwork.
   They can be found at :file:`/var/lib/tomcat6/logs/catalina.out`.

 * **PostgreSQL logs**: Postgres is accessed by GeoNetwork, GeoServer and Django, therefore, very hard to debug errors could be found by looking at PostgreSQL's logs.
   They are located at :file:`/var/log/postgresql/postgresql-8.4-main.log`.


Enabling DEBUG mode
=================== 

Django can be set to return pretty formatted exceptions instead of ``500 errors``.
This can be set by setting ``DEBUG=True`` in :file:`/etc/geonode/local_settings.py`.

After enabling DEBUG, the Apache server has to be restarted for the changes to be picked up. In Ubuntu::

    sudo service apache2 restart
