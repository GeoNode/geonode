What is GeoNode
===============

.. image:: img/logo.png

GeoNode is a geospatial content management system, a platform for the management and publication of geospatial data. It brings together mature and stable open-source software projects under a consistent and easy-to-use interface allowing non-specialized users to share data and create interactive maps.

Data management tools built into GeoNode allow for integrated creation of data, metadata, and map visualization. Each dataset in the system can be shared publicly or restricted to allow access to only specific users. Social features like user profiles and commenting and rating systems allow for the development of communities around each platform to facilitate the use, management, and quality control of the data the GeoNode instance contains.

It is also designed to be a flexible platform that software developers can extend, modify or integrate against to meet requirements in their own applications.

Showcase
--------

A handful of other Open Source projects extend GeoNodeâ€™s functionality
by tapping into the re-usability of Django applications. 
Visit our gallery to see how the community uses GeoNode: `GeoNode Showcase <http://geonode.org/gallery/>`_.

The development community is very supportive of new projects and contributes ideas and guidance for newcomers.

Roadmap
=======

GeoNode's development roadmap is documented in a series of GeoNode Improvement Projects (GNIPS).
They are documented at `GeoNode Wiki <https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/wiki/GeoNode-Improvement-Proposals>`_.

GNIPS are considered to be large undertakings which will add a large amount of features to the project. 
As such they are the topic of community dicussion and guidance. 

The community discusses these on the developer mailing list: http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/geonode-devel/
