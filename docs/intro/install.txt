Quick installation guide
========================

The following is a quick guide to get GeoNode up and running in most common operating systems.

Recommended Minimum System Requirements
=======================================

For deployment of GeoNode on a single server, the following are the bare minimum system requirements:

* 6GB of RAM, including swap space.
* 2.2GHz processor.  (Additional processing power may be required for multiple concurrent styling renderings)
* 1 GB software disk usage.
* Additional disk space for any data hosted with GeoNode and tiles cached with GeoWebCache.
  For spatial data, cached tiles, and "scratch space" useful for administration, a decent baseline size for GeoNode deployments is 100GB.
* 64-bit hardware recommended.


Linux
=====

Ubuntu
------

The easiest way to get the .deb is to install it using APT, the standard installation management tool for Ubuntu and other Debian-based systems.

1. Set up the GeoNode PPA repository (you only need to do this once; the repository will still be available for upgrades later)::

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:geonode/release

2. Install the package.
   This step will also automatically download any needed dependencies::

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install geonode

Once the package is installed, please consult the :doc:`/deploy/production` to learn how to create the admin user and tweak the settings to get more performance.

CentOS/RHEL  and other *nix distros
-----------------------------------

We recommend you to download the latest release and modify the included ``install.sh`` and ``support/config.sh``. GeoNode has been installed in CentOS/RHEL using this mechanism.

Once the package is installed, please consult the :doc:`/deploy/production` to learn how to create the admin user and tweak the settings to get more performance.


Windows, OSX and others
=======================

The recommended install method in these platforms is to use a virtualization solution, like `Virtual Box`_, install the latest `Ubuntu Linux`_ and then proceed with the steps mentioned above.
