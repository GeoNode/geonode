About GeoNode
=============

GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data.
The project aims to surpass existing spatial data infrastructure solutions by integrating robust social and cartographic tools.

At its core, GeoNode has a stack based on GeoServer, Django, and GeoExt that provides a platform for sophisticated web browser spatial visualization and analysis.
Atop this stack, the project has built a map composer and viewer, tools for analysis, and reporting tools.


Online demo
===========

A live demo of the latest stable build is available at `demo.geonode.org`_. 

Anyone may sign up for a user account, upload and style data, create and share maps, and change permissions.
Since it is a demo site, we donâ€™t make any guarantee that your data and maps will always be there.
But it should hopefully allow you to easily preview the capabilities of GeoNode.

Geospatial data storage
=======================

GeoNode allows the upload vector and raster data in their original projections using a web form.
Vector data is uploaded in ESRI Shapefile format and satellite imagery and other kinds of raster data are uploaded as Geotiffs.

Especiall importance is given to standard metadata formats like TC211, after the upload is finished, the user is presented with a form to fill in the metadata and it is made available using a `CSW`_ interface.

Similarly, GeoNode provides a web based styler, that lets the user change how the data looks and preview the changes in real time.

Data mixing, maps creation
==========================

Once the data has been uploaded, GeoNode let's the user search for it geographically or via keywords and create maps.

All the layers are automatically reprojected to mercator for the maps, making it possible to use different popular base layers, like Open Street Map, Google Satellite or Bing layers.

Once maps are saved, it is possible to embed them in any webpage or get a PDF version for printing.


GeoNode as a building block
===========================

A handful of other Open Source projects, like `Risk in a Box`_ extend GeoNode's functionality by tapping into the re-usability of Django applications.

The development community is very supportive of new projects and contributes ideas and guidance for newcomers.


Convinced! Where do I sign?
===========================

The next obvious steps are to :doc:`install GeoNode </intro/install>`, :doc:`read the tutorials </users/uploading>` and `join the community`_. Thanks for your interest!
