=======================
GeoNode's documentation
=======================
Welecome to Geonode the Content Management System for geospatial data.  Here you will find all the documentation to geonode 2.0

How the Documentation is Organized
==================================
We have three sections. Each are described in detail below.
 #. **Organisational**  how to contribute, about, other info.
 #. **Tutorials**  are based on performing tasks.
 #. **Reference**  code reference, api, all components in detail.

We also have three users types. So pick which one you are and start surfing.
 #. **Users**  you are a person who logs into Geonode and starts just using it.
 #. **Administrators**  you are wanting to install, play, setup, test out geonode but are not going to do any coding
 #. **Developers**  you are a coder, you want to add functionality, integrate in some other system, fix bugs and well help code a beter Geonode.

First Steps
===========

The following documents give an overview to GeoNode, they are targeted at a non-technical audience and the quick installation guide at people who just want to get it installed and will come back later to the complete documentation.

 * :doc:`About GeoNode <organizational/overview>`
 * :doc:`Quick Installation Guide <intro/install>`
 * :doc:`Detail Installation Guide <intro/install_detail>`

Tutorials
=========
Tutorials are based around performing tasks, like adding data or publishing maps.  The tutorials are written in a workshop like format.  Once again the tutorials are broken into three groups Users, Administrators and Developers.

Old Docs
========
Here are the old docs that still need to move

For users
---------

Users are not required to have experience with GIS systems but most power GeoNode users have existing knowledge of tools like ESRI's ArcGIS or QGIS.

The end user documentation is formatted in form of tutorials, this material has mostly been developed for workshops during FOSS4G and similar conferences.

 * :doc:`Tutorials Overview <tutorials/users/index>`
 * :doc:`Registering a New Account <tutorials/users/register>`
 * :doc:`Adding New Data <tutorials/users/upload>`
 * :doc:`Creating Maps <tutorials/users/create>`
 * :doc:`Exploring Maps <tutorials/users/explore>`
 * :doc:`Sharing and Printing <tutorials/users/share>`
