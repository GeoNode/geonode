GeoNode's Documentation
=======================

Welcome to Geonode's Documentation. GeoNode is an Open Source, Content Management System (CMS) for geospatial data. It is a web-based application and platform for developing geospatial information systems (GIS) and for deploying spatial data infrastructures (SDI). 

How To Use The Documentation
============================

The documentation is divided into three sections.

 #. :doc:`Organizational <organizational/index>`  about, how to contribute, links, resources, other info
 #. :doc:`Tutorials <tutorials/index>`  are based on performing tasks in a workshop like format
 #. :doc:`Reference <reference/index>`  code reference, api, all components, architecture in detail


For organizational purposes, the documentation is also geared toward 3 distinct types of users.

 #. **Users**  Are people who log into a GeoNode website and use its functionality. 
 #. **Administrators** Are people who install and deploy GeoNode websites in production for their Users. 
 #. **Developers**  Are people who write code to add functionality, integrate with other systems, fix bugs, and potentially help an Administrator setup a server and deploy a GeoNode instance for production. 

First Steps
===========

The following sections give an overview of GeoNode from different perspectives, they are targeted at a non-technical audience and the quick installation guide at people who just want to get it installed and will come back later to the complete documentation.

 * :doc:`About GeoNode <organizational/about>`
 * :doc:`GeoNode Quickstart <tutorials/users/quickstart/index>`
 * :doc:`Quick Installation Guide <tutorials/admin/install/quick_install>`
 * :doc:`Detailed Installation Guide <tutorials/admin/install/installation_devmode>`

Organizational
==============

:doc:`Organizational <organizational/index>` is the section about the GeoNode project itself, how to contribute, learn about the community, links, review process, roadmap and other administraive items.

Tutorials
=========

:doc:`Tutorials <tutorials/index>` are oriented around performing particular sets of tasks, like adding data or publishing maps, setting up and maintaining a server, or setting up a project to extend from geonode. These tutorials are written in a workshop like format and are broken into three groups Users, Administrators and Developers. 

Reference
=========

The :doc:`Reference <reference/index>` section provides details about the internals of the GeoNode project. It has background information about components that make up GeoNode, the security system, APIs and much more.
