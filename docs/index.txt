GeoNode's Documentation
=======================

Welcome to GeoNode's Documentation.

GeoNode is an Open Source, Content Management System (CMS) for geospatial data. It is a web-based application and platform for developing geospatial information systems (GIS) and for deploying spatial data infrastructures (SDI). 

First Steps
===========

The following sections give an overview of GeoNode from different perspectives, they are targeted at a non-technical audience and the quick installation guide at people who just want to get it installed and will come back later to the complete documentation.

 * :doc:`About GeoNode <about>`
 * :doc:`Quick Installation Guide <tutorials/install_and_admin/quick_install>`
 * :doc:`GeoNode Users Quickstart Manual <tutorials/overview_and_ref/introduction/geonode_quickstart>`


How To Use The Documentation
============================

The documentation is geared toward three distinct types of users:

 #. **Users**: Are people who log into a GeoNode website and use its functionality. 
 #. **Administrators**: Are people who install and deploy GeoNode websites in production for their Users. 
 #. **Developers**:  Are people who write code to add functionality, integrate with other systems, fix bugs, and potentially help an Administrator setup a server and deploy a GeoNode instance for production. 


The documentation is divided into three sections:

 #. :doc:`Tutorials: <tutorials/index>` Step-by-step instructions in workshop format that help a user to accomplish a set of tasks.
 #. :doc:`Reference: <reference/index>` Architecture, component information, API descriptions etc. 
 #. :doc:`Organizational: <organizational/index>`  About the project, how to contribute, links, resources, other info.
