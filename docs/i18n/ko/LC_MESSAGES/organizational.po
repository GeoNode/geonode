"**GeoNode is a geospatial content management system**, a platform for the "
"management and publication of geospatial data. It brings together mature and"
" stable open-source software projects under a consistent and easy-to-use "
"interface allowing non-specialized users to share data and create "
"interactive maps."
msgstr "**GeoNode는 지리공간 컨텐츠 관리 시스템**이고, 지리공간 데이터의 관리 및 게시를 위한 플랫폼 입니다. GeoNode는 비전문가가 데이터를 공유하고 대화형 지도를 생성할 수 있도록 일관되고 사용하기 쉬운 인터페이스와 함께 성숙하고 안정적인 오픈 소스 소프트웨어 프로젝트를 제공합니다."

"Data management tools built into GeoNode allow for integrated creation of "
"data, metadata, and map visualizations. Each dataset in the system can be "
"shared publicly or restricted to allow access to only specific users. Social"
" features like user profiles and commenting and rating systems allow for the"
" development of communities around each platform to facilitate the use, "
"management, and quality control of the data the GeoNode instance contains."
msgstr "GeoNode에 내장된 데이터 관리 도구는데이터, 메터데이터 및 지도 시각화의 통합 생성을 할 수 있도록 합니다. 시스템의 각 데이터셋은 공개적으로 공유하거나 특정 사용자만 접근할 수 있도록 제한할 수 있습니다. 사용자 프로필, 댓글, 평가 시스템과 같은 소셜 기능은 GeoNode 인스턴스가 포함하고 있는 데이터의 사용, 관리, 품질관리를 용이하게 하도록 각 플랫폼의 커뮤니티 발전을 돕습니다."
