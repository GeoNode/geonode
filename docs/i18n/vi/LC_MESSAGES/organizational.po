"**GeoNode is a geospatial content management system**, a platform for the "
"management and publication of geospatial data. It brings together mature and"
" stable open-source software projects under a consistent and easy-to-use "
"interface allowing non-specialized users to share data and create "
"interactive maps."
msgstr ""

"Data management tools built into GeoNode allow for integrated creation of "
"data, metadata, and map visualizations. Each dataset in the system can be "
"shared publicly or restricted to allow access to only specific users. Social"
" features like user profiles and commenting and rating systems allow for the"
" development of communities around each platform to facilitate the use, "
"management, and quality control of the data the GeoNode instance contains."
