"By default, unregistered users can view maps, layers, and documents on your "
"site without being authenticated.  GeoNode comes a security option that "
"requires users to authenticate before accessing any page.  To enable this "
"option, set the ``LOCKDOWN_GEONODE`` setting to true in your ``settings.py`` "
"file.  You can fine-tune which url routes are white-listed (accessible by "
"unregistered users) by listing the routes in the ``AUTH_EXEMPT_URLS`` "
"tuple.  See the :ref:`djangoapps` documentation for more information."
