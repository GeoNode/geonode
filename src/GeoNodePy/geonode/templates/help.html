<p>The CAPRA GeoNode provides access to risk data as well as
  particular refined data sets.  These can be freely combined to create
  maps that visualize risks for specific regions.  A map editing
  application allows users to browse existing maps and contribute their
  own.
</p>
<a name='browsing-data><h4>Browsing Data</h4></a>
         <p>The <a href='data'>Data
           </a> tab allows you to browse data
           produced for the CAPRA project.
         </p>
<p>
  All data can be downloaded in a variety of formats, for use in other
  applications.
</p>
<p>Three kinds of data are available:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The Risk section contains the actual risk maps resulting from the
    hazard layers and the risk models.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Hazard section consists of the .AME data files that represent the
    probabilities of various hazards (earthquakes, landslides, cyclones,
    etc.) over different amounts of time.  A whole .AME file can be
    downloaded to power a new risk model, or individual slices of the .AME
    can be downloaded as GeoTiffs.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Base layer section contains all the base data sets that go in to
    constructing the hazard and risk models, so that anyone who is
    interested in creating and running their own models can start with the
    exact same datasets.
  </li>

</ul>

<a name='developer-access'><h4>Developer Access</h4></a>
<p>
  The <a href='developer'> Developer</a> tab is the place for
  developers to get started building applications against the CAPRA
  GeoNode.  It includes instructions on using the web services, links to
  the source code of the GeoNode, and information about the open source
  projects used to create it.
</p>
<a name='browsing-maps'><h4>Browsing Maps</h4></a>
<p>The CAPRA GeoNode allows users to create and share maps with one
  another.
</p>
<p>The <a href='community'>Contributed Maps
  </a> tab shows the
  maps that have been contributed by the community.  Any map created in
  the Map Editor will be automatically listed on the page.
</p>
<p>To view any of the maps on either tab simply click on the title and
  then hit <b>Open Map
  </b> button.  This will open
  the <a href='maps/new'>Map Composer
  </a> to your selected map.
</p>
<h5>Google Earth Mode
</h5>
<p>Any map viewed in the interactive map editor can be seen in 3D mode
  with the Google Earth plugin.  To switch to 3D mode select the Google
  Earth globe logo, the rightmost button on top toolbar.  If you do not
  have the Google Earth plugin installed you will be prompted to install
  it. 
</p>
<a name='creating-a-map'>
  <h4>Creating a Map</h4>
</a>
<p>To create a new map go to the <a href='community'>Contributed
    Maps
  </a> tab and click the <a href='maps/new'>create your own map
  </a>
  link.
</p>
<p> This will take you to the <a href='maps/new'>Map Composer
  </a> with
  a base layer loaded.
</p>
<p>To add data layers from the CAPRA GeoNode click on the green plus
  button located below the Data tab on the left hand side of the screen.
  This will open a dialog listing all the layers available on the CAPRA
  GeoNode.
</p>
<p>To add layers to your map select them and hit the <b>Add Layers
  </b>
  button.  When finished you may hit <b>Done
  </b> to close the dialog and
  go back to the map.
</p>
<h5>Reordering and Removing Layers
</h5>
<p>Change the display order of the layers listed in the data tab by
  simply dragging and dropping their names.  The order in the map will
  be updated to reflect that.  To turn a layer's visibility off simply
  uncheck it, and to remove it entirely select it and hit the red minus
  button.
</p>
<h5>Saving your map
</h5>
<p>Once a suitable set of layers and zoom level has been found it's
  time to save it so others can see it.  To do this select the '+' icon
  to the right of 'About this Map'.  This should expand in to a dialog
  to customize the Title, Contact, Abstract and Tags.  These will appear
  in the online list of maps, and will be used to search for the created
  map, so be as detailed as possible.  After filling out this basic
  information you then save the map.  This is the left most icon on the
  top toolbar, an image of a map with a disk.
</p>
<a name='exporting-a-map'>
  <h4>Exporting a Map</h4>
</a>
<p>Any map from the GeoNode can be embedded for use in another site or blog.  To export a map:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the from the list of maps on the community or CAPRA map
    page and then hit the 'export map' button.
  </li> 
  <li>Choose your desired height and width for the widget in the wizard.
  </li> 
  <li>Copy the HTML snippet provided in the wizard to any HTML
    page or iFrame-supporting blog post.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>This will put an interactive widget showing you map in your web
  pageor blog post.  The <a href='index'>Featured Map
  </a> page ispowered by just this kind of widget..
</p><p>Note that the <a href='maps/new'>Map Composer
  </a> also has a button to export the map.  Just be sure to save the
  map before exporting if there are changes that you want others to
  see.  It exports the last saved version, not the last viewed
  version.
</p>
<a name='remixing-a-map'>
  <h4>Remixing a Map</h4>
</a>
<p>Any map available can serve as a starting point for a new map.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the map.
  </li>
  <li>Add and remove layers as you
    like.
  </li>
  <li>Pan and zoom to highlight the area of
    interest.
  </li>
  <li><b>IMPORTANT:
    </b> Update the title, abstract,
    contact info and tags to reflect the new map.
  </li><li>Save the
    map.
  </li>

</ol>
You will be able to see your new map in
the <a href='community'>Contributed Maps
</a> tab.
