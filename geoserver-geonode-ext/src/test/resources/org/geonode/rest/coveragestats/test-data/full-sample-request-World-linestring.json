#Fully functioning test request, including input geometry other than point, crs information, and political Layer
#Coverage is in EPSG:4326
#request geometry is in EPSG:26986 ("NAD83 / Massachusetts Mainland")
#request geometry starts somewhere close to the intersection point for NY, PA, and NJ and follows the border between NY and PA
#radius is in the same units than the point's CRS. That is, meters
