#Fully functioning test request, BUT the buffered geometry is too small to gather the statistics for the coverage. I.e., covers
#less than a coverage's pixel area. @see testBufferedInputGeometryTooSmall()
#request geometry is in EPSG:26986 ("NAD83 / Massachusetts Mainland")
#request geometry starts somewhere close to the intersection point for NY, PA, and NJ and follows the border between NY and PA
#radius is in the same units than the point's CRS. That is, meters
