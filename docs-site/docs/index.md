# GeoNode Documentation

!!! warning
    This version of the **GeoNode Documentation** is a full rewrite of the old one. It will be completed during the following weeks. We invite you to check the [old documentation](https://docs.geonode.org/en/4.4.x/) for any missing information.

Welcome to the **GeoNode** Documentation.

GeoNode is an Open Source, Content Management System (CMS) for geospatial data. It serves as a web-based application and platform for developing geospatial information systems (GIS) and for deploying spatial data infrastructures (SDI).

As a geospatial content management system, GeoNode is a platform dedicated to the management and publication of geospatial data. It achieves this by bringing together mature and stable open-source software projects under a consistent and easy-to-use interface. This design allows non-specialized users to share data and create interactive maps.
GeoNode includes data management tools that allow for the integrated creation of data, metadata, and map visualization. Each dataset within the system can be shared publicly or restricted to allow access to only specific users. Furthermore, GeoNode is designed to be a flexible platform that software developers can extend, modify or integrate to meet the requirements of their own applications.
