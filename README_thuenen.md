# Thünen Atlas Fork of GeoNode

This image is built from a fork of [Geonode](https://github.com/geonode/geonode).
[Thünen Institute](https://thuenen.de) maintains an own fork of GeoNode in order to make necessary adjustments within projects which are not (yet) part of GeoNode core.

However, we are interested to stay as close to upstream as possible, to benefit from ongoing development, but also to contribute features and fixes we develop in [Thünen Atlas project](https://atlas.thuenen.de).

This image (`52north/geonode_thuenen`) is built from the `thuenen_4.x` branch of the [`Thuenen-GeoNode-Development/geonode` repository](https://github.com/Thuenen-GeoNode-Development/geonode/tree/thuenen_4.x).
