Additional Libraries and Code used
*************************************************************************
GeoServer uses several additional libraries and pieces of code.  We are 
including the appropriate notices in this file.  We'd like to thank all
the creators of the libraries we rely on, GeoServer would certainly not
be possible without them.  There are also several LGPL libraries that do
not require us to cite them, but we'd like to thank GeoTools - 
http://geotools.org, JTS - http://www.vividsolutions.com/jts/jtshome.htm
 WKB4J http://wkb4j.sourceforge.net iText - http://www.lowagie.com/iText/ 
and J. David Eisenberg's PNG encoder http://www.catcode.com/pngencoder/

GeoServer also thanks Anthony Dekker for the NeuQuant Neural-Net Quantization
Algorithm.  The copyright notice is intact in the source code and also here:

The GeoServer Project also thank J. M. G. Elliot for his improvements on 
Jef Poskanzer's GifEncoder.  Notice is included below on his Elliot's 
release to public domain and Poskanzer's original notice (which is new
BSD).  Source code is included in GeoServer source, with modifications done
by David Blasby for TOPP.  

------
Since Gif89Encoder includes significant sections of code from Jef Poskanzer's
GifEncoder.java, I'm including its notice in this distribution as requested (appended
below).

As for my part of the code, I hereby release it, on a strictly "as is" basis,

GeoServer also includes binaries and from Jetty, the standard version can be 
found at http://jetty.mortbay.org, released under an OSI-approved artistic
license.  We include the license completely, as some versions will be 
distributed without full source.

------
Jetty License
$Revision: 3.7 $
Preamble:

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which the Jetty Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use, distribute and make reasonable modifications to the Package in accordance with the goals and ideals of the Open Source concept as described at http://www.opensource.org.

It is the intent of this license to allow commercial usage of the Jetty package, so long as the source code is distributed or suitable visible credit given or other arrangements made with the copyright holders.

Definitions:

    * "Jetty" refers to the collection of Java classes that are distributed as a HTTP server with servlet capabilities and associated utilities.

    * "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.

    * "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.

    * "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.
      Mort Bay Consulting Pty. Ltd. (Australia) is the "Copyright Holder" for the Jetty package.

    * "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

    * "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

    * "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

0. The Jetty Package is Copyright (c) Mort Bay Consulting Pty. Ltd. (Australia) and others. Individual files in this package may contain additional copyright notices. The javax.servlet packages are copyright Sun Microsystems Inc.

1. The Standard Version of the Jetty package is available from http://jetty.mortbay.org.

2. You may make and distribute verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you include this license and all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

3. You may make and distribute verbatim copies of the compiled form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you include this license.

4. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

5. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

    a) Place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

    b) Use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

    c) Rename any non-standard classes so the names do not conflict with standard classes, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard class that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

    d) Make other arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

6. You may distribute modifications or subsets of this Package in source code or compiled form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

    a) Distribute this license and all original copyright messages, together with instructions (in the about dialog, manual page or equivalent) on where to get the complete Standard Version.

    b) Accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications. The modified package must include this license and all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers, together with instructions on where to get the complete Standard Version.

    c) Make other arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

7. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you meet the other distribution requirements of this license.

8. Input to or the output produced from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

12. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

13. If any superior law implies a warranty, the sole remedy under such shall be , at the Copyright Holders option either a) return of any price paid or b) use or reasonable endeavours to repair or replace the software.
