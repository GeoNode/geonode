GeoNode's Documentation
=======================

Welcome to Geonode the Content Management System for geospatial data. Here you will find all the documentation to Geonode 2.0

How To Use The Documentation
============================

We have three sections. Each are described in detail below.

 #. :doc:`Tutorials <tutorials/index>`  are based on performing tasks in a workshop like format
 #. :doc:`Reference <reference/index>`  code reference, api, all components, architecture in detail
 #. :doc:`Organizational <organizational/index>`  about, how to contribute, links, resources, other info

We also have three users types. So pick which one you are and start surfing.

 #. **Users**  you are a person who logs into a Geonode website and starts using it
 #. **Administrators**  you want to install, play, setup, try your own geonode
 #. **Developers**  you are a coder, want to add functionality, integrate in some other system, fix bugs

First Steps
===========

The following documents give an overview to GeoNode, they are targeted at a non-technical audience and the quick installation guide at people who just want to get it installed and will come back later to the complete documentation.

 * :doc:`About GeoNode <organizational/about>`
 * :doc:`Quick Installation Guide <tutorials/admin/doc/install/quick_install>`
 * :doc:`Detail Installation Guide <tutorials/admin/doc/install/installation_devmode>`

Tutorials
=========

:doc:`Tutorials <tutorials/index>` are based around performing tasks, like adding data or publishing maps. The tutorials are written in a workshop like format and are broken into three groups Users, Administrators and Developers. 

Reference
=========

The :doc:`Reference <reference/index>` section is all about Geonode details. You will see the components, security, API and many more.

Organizational
==============

:doc:`Organizational <organizational/index>` is  the section about Geonode, how to contribute, learn about the community, links, review process, roadmap and other administraive stuff.
