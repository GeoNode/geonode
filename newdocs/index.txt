=======================
GeoNode's documentation
=======================
Welecome to Geonode the Content Management System for geospatial data.  Here you will find all the documentation to geonode 2.0

How the Documentation is Organized
==================================
We have three sections. Each are described in detail below.
 #. **Organisational**  how to contribute, about, other info.
 #. **Tutorials**  are based on performing tasks.
 #. **Reference**  code reference, api, all components in detail.

We also have three users types. So pick which one you are and start surfing.
 #. **Users**  you are a person who logs into Geonode and starts just using it.
 #. **Administrators**  you are wanting to install, play, setup, test out geonode but are not going to do any coding
 #. **Developers**  you are a coder, you want to add functionality, integrate in some other system, fix bugs and well help code a beter Geonode.

First Steps
===========

The following documents give an overview to GeoNode, they are targeted at a non-technical audience and the quick installation guide at people who just want to get it installed and will come back later to the complete documentation.

 * :doc:`About GeoNode <organizational/overview>`
