  <h2>{% trans "Please Submit Map Service Endpoint" %}</h2>

  <p>Please describe to the best of your ability the topic of the data within the map service,
    the name of the organization hosting the map service, the source of the data if different from the host,
    the year or year range the data represents.
    Service harvesting and loading to WorldMap is currently a manual process though this will eventually be automated.
    For this reason it may take some time for your service to appear in search.
    The system currently supports OGC WMS and CSW, as well as Esri Image and Map service endpoint types.
    If you are not sure what you have, feel free to submit and we will attempt to load it.
    Write us at worldmap@harvard.edu if you have any questions.
  <p>
