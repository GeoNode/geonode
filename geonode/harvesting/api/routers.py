    """A router that allows performing PATCH requests against the `list` endpoint

    This router is used in order to provide API endpoints that respond to PATCH
    requsts against a viewset's `list` endpoint. It is useful for situations where it
    is necessary to perform a batch update of multiple resources. For a use case,
    consider the selection of which remote resources should be harvestable by the local
    GeoNode:

    - User is shown a (paginated) list of resources that are available on the remote
    service
    - User must now choose which of these harvestable resources should be harvested
    - Instead of forcing the user to make multiple PATCH requests to each harvestable
    resource's detail page in order to set the resource's `should_be_harvested`
    property, user can perform a PATCH request to
    `harvesters/{harvester-id}/harvestable-resources` and set multiple resources'
    `should_be_harvested` at the same time
