GeoNode Collections app
=======================

The Collections app allows to present, in a single page, resources and users grouped by a GeoNode Group.
To a Collection can be assigned arbitrary resources, a Group and a name that will be also used to build a dedicated URL.


Installation
------------

- Add `geonode.contrib.collections`to your installed apps
- Add `(r'^collections/', include('geonode.contrib.collections.urls')),` to the GeoNode main urls.py file
- Run `GeoNode syncdb`


How to use it
-------------

Collections provides an admin page where to add new collections. There it is possible to associate an arbitrary number of resources to a group.
Collections are published through JSON APIs at `/api/collections` and each collection has a dedicated API at `/api/collections/COLLECTION_ID`. The API, for each collection, provides:

- users, the list of the users that belong to the collection's group
- resources, the full serialization of the resources including the owner
- group, the group owning the collection
- name, the name of the collection
- slug, a unique slugified name

The APIs can be consumed by any client library.
