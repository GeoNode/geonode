This directory contains unit tests for the OpenLayers library.

Tests use the Test.AnotherWay library from <http://openjsan.org>. The test
runner is 'run-tests.html' and new test files need to be added to
'list-tests.html'.

The following file naming conventions are used:

  * A filename that starts with `test_` and has an `.html` extension
    contains tests. These should contain tests for a specific class.

  * A filename starting with `page_` and has an `.html` extension is a
    supporting HTML file used in one or more tests.

  * A filename starting with 'data_` is a supporting data file used in one
    or more tests.
