"\n"
"    <p>All the code that runs GeoNode is open source. The code is available "
"at <a href=\"http://github.com/GeoNode/geonode\">http://github.com/GeoNode/"
"geonode/</a>. The issue tracker for the project is at <a href=\"http://"
"github.com/GeoNode/geonode/issues\">http://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/"
"issues</a>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"    <p>GeoNode is built using several open source projects, each with its "
"own community. If you are interested in contributing new features to the "
"GeoNode, we encourage you to do so by contributing to one of the projects on "
"which it is built:</p>\n"
"    <ul>\n"
"      <li><a href=\"http://geoext.org\">GeoExt</a> - The JavaScript toolkit "
"for rich web mapping applications</li>\n"
"      <li><a href=\"http://geoserver.org\">GeoServer</a> - Standards based "
"server for geospatial information</li>\n"
"      <li><a href=\"http://geowebcache.org\">GeoWebCache</a> - Cache engine "
"for WMS Tiles</li><li><a href=\"http://openlayers.org\">OpenLayers</a> - "

"PMH metadata catalogue server</li>\n"
"    </ul>\n"
"\n"
"    <h3>What are OGC Services?</h3>\n"
"    <p>The data in this application is served using open standards endorsed "
"by the <a href=\"http://opengeospatial.org/\">Open Geospatial Consortium</"
"a>; in particular, WMS (Web Map Service) is used for accessing maps, WFS "
"(Web Feature Service) is used for accessing vector data, and WCS (Web "
"Coverage Service) is used for accessing raster data.  WMC (Web Map Context "
"Documents) is used for sharing maps. You can use these services in your own "
"applications using libraries such as OpenLayers, GeoTools, and OGR (all of "
"which are open-source software and available at zero cost).</p>\n"
"\n"
"    <h3>What is GeoWebCache?</h3>\n"
"    <p>GeoWebCache provides mapping tiles that are compatible with a number "
"of mapping engines, including Google Maps, Bing Maps and OpenLayers. All the "
"data hosted by GeoNode is also available through GeoWebCache. GeoWebCache "
"improves on WMS by caching data and providing more responsive maps.</p>\n"
"\n"
"    <h3>CSW Example Code</h3>\n"
"    <p>To interact with GeoNode's CSW you can use any CSW client (QGIS "
"MetaSearch, GRASS, etc.).  The following example illustrates a simple "
"invocation using the OWSLib Python package:</p>\n"
"    <p><code>from owslib.csw import CatalogueServiceWeb</code></p>\n"
"    <p><code>from owslib.fes import PropertyIsLike</code></p>\n"
"    <p><code>csw = CatalogueServiceWeb('%(CATALOGUE_BASE_URL)s')</code></p>\n"
"    <p><code>anytext = PropertyIsLike('csw:AnyText', 'birds')')</code></p>\n"
"    <p><code>csw.getrecords2(constraints=[anytext])</code></p>\n"
"    <p><code>print csw.results</code></p>\n"
"    <p><code>print csw.records</code></p>\n"
"\n"
"    <h3>OpenLayers Example Code</h3>\n"
"\n"
"    <p>To include a GeoNode map layer in an OpenLayers map, first find the "
"name for that layer. This is found in the layer's <code>name</code> field "
"(not <code>title</code>) of the layer list. For this example, we will use "
"the Nicaraguan political boundaries background layer, whose name is "
"<code>risk:nicaragua_admin</code>. Then, create an instance of OpenLayers."
"Layer.WMS:</p>\n"
"    <p><code>var geonodeLayer = new OpenLayers.Layer.WMS(\"GeoNode Risk Data"
"\", \"http://demo.geonode.org/geoserver/wms\",{ layers: \"risk:"
"nicaragua_admin\" });</code></p>\n"
"\n"
"    <h3>Google Maps Example Code</h3>\n"
"    <p>To include a GeoNode map layer in a Google Map, include the layer "
"namein the URL template.</p>\n"
"    <p><code>var tilelayer =  new GTileLayer(null, null, null, "

"layers=risk:nicaragua_admin&#38;zoom={Z}&#38;x={X}&#38;y={Y}', isPng:true, "
"opacity:0.5 } );</code></p>\n"
"\n"
"    <h3>Shapefile/GeoJSON/GML Output</h3>\n"
"    <p>To get data from the GeoNode web services use the WFS protocol. For "
"example, to get the full Nicaraguan admin boundaries use:</p>\n"
"    <p><code>http://demo.geonode.org/geoserver/wfs?request=GetFeature&#38;"
"typeName=risk:nicaragua_admin&#38;outputformat=SHAPE-ZIP</code></p>\n"
"    <p>Changing output format to <code>json</code>, <code>GML2</code>, "
"<code>GML3</code>, or <code>csv</code> will get data in those formats. The "
"WFS protocol also can handle more precise queries, specifying a bounding box "
"or various spatial and non-spatial filters based on the attributes of the "
"data.</p>\n"
"\n"
"    <h3>GeoTools Example Code</h3>\n"
"    <p>Create a DataStore and extract a FeatureType from it, then run a "
"Query. It is all documented on the wiki at <code>http://geotools.org/</code>."
