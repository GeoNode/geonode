msgid "Unexpected error!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" - 400 Bad Request. Server cannot or will not process the request due to "
"something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request "
"syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" - 401 Unauthorized. Request was not sent with the proper authentication "
"credentials."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" - 403 Forbidden. This is generally related to permission rules on your "
"server. Contact the system administrator for more information regarding this "
"error message."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" - 404 Not Found. Origin server was unable or unwilling to find the resource "
"requested."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" - 405 Method Not Allowed. Origin server is aware of the requested resource, "
"but the request method used is not supported."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" - 406 Not Acceptable. Resource is not available at the origin that adheres "
"to negotiation headers that were  set prior (e.g. via 'Accept-Charset' and "
"'Accept-Language' headers)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" - 407 Authentication Required. The client did not send the required "
"authentication with the request."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" - 408 Request Timeout. The origin server did not receive the complete "
"request in what it considers a reasonable time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" - 409 Conflict. The request did not complete because of a conflict with the "
"current state of the resource. Typically happens on a PUT request where "
"multiple clients are attempting to edit the same resource."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" - 410 Gone. The resource requested is permanently missing at the origin."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" - 411 Length Required. Client did not define the 'Content-Length' of the "
"request body in the headers and this is required to obtain the resource."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" - 412 Precondition Failed. Server denies the request because the resource "
"failed to meet the conditions specified by the client."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" - 413 Payload Too Large. Refusal from the server to process the request "
"because the payload sent from the client is larger than the server wished to "
"accept. Server has the optional to close the connection."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" - 414 URI Too Long. Refusal from the server that the URI was too long to be "
"processed. For example, if a client is attempting a GET request with an "
"unusually long URI after a POST, this could be seen as a security risk and a "
"414 gets generated."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" - 415 Unsupported Media Type. Refusal from the server to process the format "
"of the current payload. One way to identify and fix this issue would be to "
"look at the 'Content-Type' or 'Content-Encoding' headers sent in the "
"client’s request."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" - 417 Expectation Failed. Failure of server to meet the requirements "
"specified in the 'Expect' header of the client’s request."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" - 429 Too Many Requests. Client has sent too many requests in the specified "
"amount of time according to the server."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" - 499 Client Close Request. Nginx specific response code to indicate when "
"the connection has been closed by the client while the server is still "
"processing its request, making server unable to send a status code back."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" - 500 Internal Server Error. This error indicates that the server has "
"encountered an unexpected condition. This often occurs when an application "
"request cannot be fulfilled due to the application being configured "
"incorrectly on the server."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" - 501 Not Implemented. This error indicates that the HTTP method sent by "
"the client is not supported by the server. This is most often caused by the "
"server being out of date. It is a very rare error and generally requires "
"that the web server be updated."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" - 502 Bad Gateway. This error is usually due to improperly configured proxy "
"servers. The first step in resolving the issue is to clear the client's "
"cache."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" - 503 Service Unavailable. This error occurs when the server is unable to "
"handle requests due to a temporary overload or due to the server being "
"temporarily closed for maintenance. The error indicates that the server will "
"only temporarily be down."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" - 504 Gateway Timeout. GeoNode lost the connection with GeoServer or DB due "
"to a connection timeout. Consider using the management commands to import "
"data!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" - 505 HTTP Version Not Supported. This error occurs when the server refuses "
"to support the HTTP protocol that has been specified by the client computer. "
"This can be caused by the protocol not being specified properly by the "
"client computer; for example, if an invalid version number has been "
"specified."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" - 506 Variant Also Negotiates. This error indicates that the server is not "
"properly configured. Contact the system administrator to resolve this issue."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" - 507 Insufficient Storage. This error indicates that the server is out of "
"free memory. This is most likely to occur when an application that is being "
"requested cannot allocate the necessary system resources to run. To resolve "
"the issue, the server's hard disk may need to be cleaned of any unnecessary "
"documents to free up more hard disk space, its memory may need to be "
"expanded, or it may simply need to be restarted. Contact the system "
"administrator for more information regarding this error message."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" - 509 Bandwidth Limit Exceeded. This error occurs when the bandwidth limit "
"imposed by the system administrator has been reached. The only fix for this "
"issue is to wait until the limit is reset in the following cycle. Consult "
"the system administrator for information about acquiring more bandwidth."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" - 510 Not Extended. This error occurs when an extension attached to the "
"HTTP request is not supported by the web server. To resolve the issue, you "
"may need to update the server."
msgstr ""
