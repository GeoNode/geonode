# Exit App Plugin

Exif is a contrib app starting with GeoNode 2.4.
The exif contrib app extracts exif metadata from uploaded JPEG documents.
This contrib app helps automatically fill key metadata gaps, such as the date a picture was taken.
If a document has exif metadata, the exif metadata is visible on a new tab on the document detail page.

Exif data can contain very valuable metadata such as the date and time a picture was taken, the GPS location, and photometric properties.
Not all this metadata is currently used.

See the Wikipedia article on Exif at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchangeable_image_file_format to learn more.
