GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. The project aims to surpass existing spatial data infrastructure solutions by integrating robust social and cartographic tools.

At its core, the GeoNode is based on open source components GeoServer, GeoNetwork, Django, and GeoExt that provide a platform for sophisticated web browser spatial visualization and analysis. Atop this stack, the project has built a map composer and viewer, tools for analysis, and reporting tools.

To promote collaboration, the GeoNode is designed on Web 2.0 principles to:

Make it extremely simple to share data
Provide user statistics
Easily add comments, ratings, tags
Allow collaborative filtering
Provide rankings of best ‘views’ and data sets contributed—such as highest rated, most viewed, most shared
Allow connectivity between several GeoNode instances to augment the collaborative potential of government GIS programs
To secure distribution, the GeoNode enables:

Simple installation and distribution
Automatic metadata creation
Versioned metadata
Search via catalogues and search engines (Google)
And, to promote data collection, the GeoNode is aimed to align incentives to create a sustainable Spatial Data Infrastructure to:

Align efforts so that amateur, commercial, NGO and governmental creators all naturally collaborate
Figure out workflows, tools and licenses that work to assure data quality
To promote ‘living’ data, constantly evolving – authoritative and always up to date
The idea is to create a full featured platform for helping decision makers easily compose and share stories told with spatial data.

History
The World Bank and OpenGeo are leading a growing community of partners in defining and developing GeoNode. Initially, the GeoNode efforts have focused on serving and visualizing the data created by the Central America Probabilistic Risk Assessment (CAPRA) initiative to assess and mitigate natural disaster risk.
